{"Username":["James Clark"],"Review Category":["Service"],"Review":[["This is a good price on a 16 GB MicroSDHC Flash card and the card works fine for holding or backing up data"," You can not, however, use this as a ReadyBoost device or in a camera for taking video"," Even though it says it is a Class 4 card, it has the slowest read write rate I have ever seen"," Far to slow to be useful for anything other than storing data you don't frequently access"]]}

{"Username":["JoulesWinfield"],"Review Category":["Service"],"Review":[["The paint actually came off from me inserting and removing the card"," I reformatted the card several times to try and make it work, to no avail"," The seller was good enough to send me a replacement for the first card after I paid to return it"," The replacement card was just as faulty as the original"," These things are cheap junk, even for a Chinese copy!"]]}
{"Username":["Crysli"],"Review Category":["Service"],"Review":[["I was purchasing a SanDisk Sansa and was looking at the 4 gig or 8 gig version"," The price difference was around 20 dollars"," However, getting this Micro SD extra storage (8 gigs worth) was only 7 dollars"," Cheaper to get the smaller MP3 player and then buy an expansion than to buy the bigger player"," Great value for the price!"]]}
