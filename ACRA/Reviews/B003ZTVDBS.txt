They do seem a bit less puffy on the ends as they used to. But still better. And I've tried other brands. I use them daily, and they're super handy for computer and other tight spot cleaning jobs. I live alone, so I now have a couple years worth of qtips. But given the cost of one of these in any retail outlet, a bargain's a bargain!"}

They are not durable. They lint up terribly and the rolled paper sticks are so soft they bend with very little pressure. OK for babies, but not for me. Will try to find someone who can use these. Just ordered some wood stick swabs that can get the job done."}

Unfortunately, the quality has on this product is not what i'd expect. It doesn't have the soft fluffiness that i've been accustomed to with the Qtip brand. First i thought that the cotton was packed tighter, but i'm halfway through a carton & have come to terms that there's Just a lot less cotton on each swab. I'm not sure if it's this lot that i've purchased through Amazon, or that it's the new standard. The last set i've purchased was through Target & Ulta, and they had the softer fluffier tips. Disappointed, since these swabs pull at my skin when removing under-eye makeup. But i'd still say they are better than the free ones you'd get in your hotel toiletry kit"}

Then I came back to Q-Tips, and truly wonder why we ever tried the others. Q-Tips have just the right amount of bend-but-don't-break to 'em, they have a proper amount of cotton, and they are definitely built to do their job. I work in cosmetics and our store just never seems to have enough supplies, so 1,000 or so are heading to work with me tomorrow (and my ladies at the counter will be sooo happy!). A couple of the packs will also be heading to our daughter in college... she came home for Fall Break intending to 'steal' a few, but we were out. Now we're not, and we promised to send them in a care package; think she expects 1,350? Ha! While most get used for typical make-up and hygiene needs, Q-Tips are outstanding for other things too. For example, our son races remote control cars and uses Q-Tips when cleaning his motors and transmissions. Additionally, my husband spends a lot of time at the range maintaining his qualifications, and he uses Q-Tips for finishing touches when cleaning the inner workings of firearms. Am very glad to have found them in bulk through Amazon's Add-on program, bringing the price equal to or less than what we paid for the discount ones. Outstanding. Q-Tip cotton swabs have been around a long time and, given their excellence, will continue to be around for a long time to come. Excellent product. Highly recommended."}

We buy these Qtips instead of the generic Qtips that are sold at the store. The major difference between real Qtips and the generic cotton swabs at a local grocery store is build quality. For example, the card board stem on these Qtips are firm and do not bend easily. PROS: - Strong card board stem, does not bend easily like the generic cotton swabs. - Really absorbent, one Qtip absorbs as much as five generic cotton swabs. CONS: - None that I can think of.

This version is made of stiff paper/cardboard. I like the somewhat fluffy tip that this Q-tip has versus a really tight one. I use Q-tips per my dermatologist's instructions to apply moisturizer around my eyes. She says this will eliminate any chance of infecting my eyes with bacteria that, even if one regularly washes the hands well, seems to accumulate under the fingernails. I also use Q-tips to clean out the inside of my electric toothbrush head, which builds up with mold far too quickly. They are also useful for cleaning mold from around sink fixtures, and excellent for dusting small pieces of electronic equipment."}

I now have them in the kitchen as well as both bathrooms. There is a difference in real Q-Tips and the cheapies. The cheap ones have cotton not as tightly wrapped on the stiff paper stick. I even use them to clean pink mold out of an indented area in the coffe pot water holder. It grows there because I fill the coffee pot too full. Oh well, by the time the water boils I figure it kills the germs that might make me more resistant to anything out to get me. Also, I learned a little trick from WebMD for itchy ears. Yes, I get itchy ears and oily ears. WedMD (and my doctor) says to mix white vinegar with water and use a Q-tip to clean your ears. I know, I know, I've seen that silly commercial on TV - Ouch! Bull feathers! If your ears are dirty, clean them. Don't forget your makeup. Baby oil, argon oil, olive oil, vegetable oil, ANY oil and a Q-tip will remove any eye makeup mistakes. A 1,001 uses for sure."}

Q-tips is the best brand for me and they are also very sturdy. I tried others but this is the best. The only brand that matters. Important facts about Q-tips: 1) they, as previous reviewers have mentioned, have more cotton at the ends. 2) said cotton tends not to end up stuck to everything other than the Q-tip, as happens with generic brands. 3) MOST IMPORTANTLY: the stick of the Q-tip is FIRM, not folding at the mere sight of an ear canal like every store brand swab does. since most people seem to disobey Q-tip packaging's direct orders NOT to put them in their ears, I figure this information would have been more ubiquitously reviewed. but since it has not been, I'm happy to report that Q-tip brand swabs are up to whatever task, or ear canal, you care to give them."}

They also help you get a better clean on your computer keyboard, since they can get down between the keys nicely.

I found that they were inconsistent as to how much or rather little cotton was on each tip. Sometimes the stick had nearly nothing in the way of fuzz on it. I was a housekeeper at the time and I relegated the cheap brand to cleaning supplies. A multi-pack might seem over doing it for a two-human household, especially with a product count of 1,875 cotton swabs. Well, we keep them all over in addition to the bathroom. Electronics, I shouldn't even mention how delicate scanners can be, and while a lint-free cloth works okay for the middle, you can't really clean the corners of the glass without, you guessed it, a Q-tip.My husband and I like to play at art and Q-tips are great for blending.

I use them daily to clean my ears, and 2-3 times a week to clean up the last bits of nail polish cotton balls can't reach. They're just perfect for ear cleaning. I can't really describe it; its one of those things you have to experience for yourself. I like to travel internationally and I ALWAYS bring Q-tips with me, since the brand is not widely available oversees. Once I forgot on a 4-week trip and had to buy flimsy plastic cotton swabs in a French grocery store. My ears never felt clean and the darn things bent all over the place and were hard to control. I've actually never tried a different brand in America. In my mind there is no need, as the perfect cotton swab is already in my reach."}

The tightly wound cotton is also a must for working with electronics (used for cleaning contacts, connectors, switches, dials, etc.) Again, this mitigates the hassle of fishing out loose fibers that have come detached from the swab. What more can really be said about a q-tip? A very decent price for enough good cotton swabs to last me for a couple years. I have to go with five stars."}

I used the Subcribe and Save option and saved an additional 5%, bringing the cost for each one down to 1 cent. They are the same Q-tips we all grew up using, with rolled paper stems and cotton tips. They're useful for so many small jobs besides cleaning ears - removing makeup or nail polish applied in the wrong place, using peroxide on small wounds, cleaning the \"eye\" on CD players with rubbing alcohol, reaching down into small vases that need cleaning, cleaning out thin tubing. We haven't had any problems with the stick bending too much or the cotton tip unwinding, like some reviews have stated. And of course they never go bad even after years of sitting in the closet, so stocking up at a good price makes sense."}

If you are an Amazon Prime member (annual fee) and buy a lot of products online, you can save money by having this shipped to you FREE and without tax (in my home state). By choosing to have it delivered at specific intervals, the price drops even further. With the price of gasoline going ever higher, this is one more way to save money.

Nowhere anywhere on the package are any pictures of, or mention of sticking one in your ear. Because you're not supposed to do that. Not since water tobacco pipes has a product been so grossly misrepresented as for one purpose when it is in fact for another. If you took a tribe of uncontacted native peoples from the deepest part of the amazon jungle and put them in a room with a box of qtips I guaranfuckingtee that every last one of them would immediately put one or more in their ear(s). As a matter of fact I'm convinced that some of the suggested uses on the box have NEVER actually been carried out. Nobody has ever taken a qtip and gently bashed it into the side of a baby's nose. The qtip labeling is the equivalent of a closeted gay guy who spends all day at work talking about how much he likes tits. The box says \"VARIETY OF USES\" in big letters on the front - it might as well say \"DEFINITELY NOT FOR PUTTING IN YOUR EAR, ONLY WIERDOS DO THAT\" \"THERE ARE MANY GOOD REASONS A NORMAL PERSON WOULD OWN THIS PRODUCT\" Oh really? then why do you sell them in packs of EIGHTEEN HUNDRED??? How often do you have to comb your eyebrows, or pick up tiny pieces of sushi? Almost never. I found that these cotton swabs performed admirably at entering, moving about within the confines of, and departing my ear canal."}

The quality is constant - all tips have adequate padding (read: you will not inadvertently stab yourself in the ear with something pointy)."}

You can use them for cleaning objects, art projects, chewing, or medical use. Qtips in the typical hosuehold is used for cleaning ears though. Most people don't realize how great it is for polishing jewelry, applying lubricants to small mechanical objects, and most of all, cleaning belly buttons! Most belly buttons smell horrible and are filled with disgusting build-up. If you buy these Qtips, you can use them to clean your belly button. With this amount you can do it on the daily basis! Trust me, a dirty belly button is disgusting and I have seen my share. Just clean your dang belly buttons, please!"}

I'm pretty sure this is enough Q-tips for the next 15 years of your life. Losers call these Cotton Swabs. If you searched Cotton Swabs you are a weirdo."}

ITEM CAME AS A 3 PACK. 2 WERE SHRINK WRAPPED, LOOKED LIKE AFTER MARKET AND ONE LEFT ON ITS OWN. OPENED THE BOX AND Q TIPS WENT EVERYWHERE. THE Q TIP BOX WAS TORN IN ADDITION TO THE GLUE AGING AND CRACKING. THIS IS THE MOST DISGUSTING EXPERIENCE I HAVE HAD TO DATE FROM AMAZON SINCE YOU WOULD HOPE THIS ITEM WAS PACKAGED WITH HYGIENE IN MIND. I THREW IT STRAIGHT INTO THE GARBAGE, I'M NOT GOING TO WASTE TIME REPACKAGING THESE AND MAKING A SPECIAL TRIP TO SEND THESE BACK NOR WOULD I RISK USING ANY OF THEM. IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE TRIED TO STUFF Q TIPS INTO THE PACKAGE, POSSIBLY FROM OTHER PACKAGES. WALMART DID A MUCH BETTER JOB OF THIS WHEN I ORDERED FROM THEM A FEW MONTHS BACK."}
