The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}]

The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder.

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out.

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts.

How convenient for them.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet.

The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you.

It's best to use the Swiffer wet and/or dry cloths fairly regularly since neither does a great job cleaning up really dirty floors. This is my second kit now.

I tried to use the Swiffer for banging against a heating vent to let my neighbors downstairs know they were making a racket, and the handle broke.

I needed something and thought the Swiffer would help. Their wet pads just pushed dirt all over, left dirt lines and didn't even clean around the grout lines even though I went through the area first with the dry pads for dirt. I would go through ~10 wet pads to \"clean\" my floors plus I would then have to go over the entire floor with my mircofiber towels. That did the job so I thought if I can replace their pads with a microfiber pads, it might work so I went on Amazon and found a microfiber cleaning pad, Tersano cleaning cloths and they fit the Swiffer head snuggly, not the XL. It works!!! I don't have to continuously buy the chemical or dry pads to fill our landfills. The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts. The investment in the Tersano pads was ~$6.00 and the original Swiffer starter kit was ~$11; not bad considering a typical sponge mop is ~$18 and are horrible on tile.

How convenient for them.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life. I start rummaging through the mess, assessing the damage. \"Wow, this trash is really piling up\", \"This window is full of cobwebs\", and \"I guess I own a cat.\" I start to view my very existence in a new light.

I wince at the crusty layer of dust and hair caking the windowsills and lining the baseboards. I wince at the realization that ultimately we will all return to dust, regardless of how hard we flail and gnash our teeth. That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop. I click together the easy to assemble rods and get right to the almost hypnotic ritual of cleansing which grants me some illusion of control, some semblance of order. I breathe deep the dust kicked up out of corners and swirling in the air. It burns my nose and the back of my throat. It reminds me that I should neither fight nor acquiesce to the interminable void. It reminds me that I should take this little ball of entropy we call life and claim it as my own. All-in-all it's great. The regular dry pad kicks up dust a bit so get the microfiber pad."]}]

You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you.

It's best to use the Swiffer wet and/or dry cloths fairly regularly since neither does a great job cleaning up really dirty floors. This is my second kit now. While the handle for the Swiffer is sturdy, it is meant only for sweeping. I tried to use the Swiffer for banging against a heating vent to let my neighbors downstairs know they were making a racket, and the handle broke.

I needed something and thought the Swiffer would help. Their wet pads just pushed dirt all over, left dirt lines and didn't even clean around the grout lines even though I went through the area first with the dry pads for dirt. I would go through ~10 wet pads to \"clean\" my floors plus I would then have to go over the entire floor with my mircofiber towels. That did the job so I thought if I can replace their pads with a microfiber pads, it might work so I went on Amazon and found a microfiber cleaning pad, Tersano cleaning cloths and they fit the Swiffer head snuggly, not the XL. It works!!! I don't have to continuously buy the chemical or dry pads to fill our landfills. The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts. The investment in the Tersano pads was ~$6.00 and the original Swiffer starter kit was ~$11; not bad considering a typical sponge mop is ~$18 and are horrible on tile.

Before finding the Swiffer, I had to lug the vacuum around and use the extension to suck all the fur off of my hardwood floors - and that didn't even pick up most of the hair. Now, I use the Swiffer twice a week and my floors are hair-free. Granted, the pads tend to fill with hair quickly, and I end up going through two each time I clean the house. To extend their life, I pick large clumps of hair off the pad as I go and use both sides of each pad as well. They're also great for dusting (no cleaning solutions required), and sometimes I'll use the pads for light dusting and then clean the floors with them. The Swiffer is great for cleaning those hard-to-reach places, too - especially under the bed.

I can't believe they would even sell a map with a clipping mechanism that is so weak. I also don't like that I have to touch the wet pads with my hands to try to get the chintzy plastic clips to hold the pad to the mop. It's awkward and I don't know what chemicals they put in these. My mop was defective and the extension button does not work. The wet pads leave my floor sticky. The dry pads just push dirt and dust around without actually picking any of it up.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you. However, for me, this lightweight sweeper is a great supplement (and possibly) replacement which makes sweeping and mopping quick, easy and hassle free! I would definitely recommend this to anyone sick of the broom and mop method!"]}, {"Username":["Pen Name"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I bought this item mainly for an apartment kitchen and bathroom.

As if shaken from a dream or a bad marriage, I suddenly notice the clutter I've been cohabiting with for a better part of a month. The grayish tint to the floorboards become less homey and more derelict. The odd smell begins to resemble something disturbingly close to rotting flesh. Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life. I start rummaging through the mess, assessing the damage. \"Wow, this trash is really piling up\", \"This window is full of cobwebs\", and \"I guess I own a cat.\" I start to view my very existence in a new light. I am no longer an adorable, up and coming, independent yuppie with my whole life in front of me. I am now a directionless, confused manchild with dangerously low self-esteem and whose college-aged idealism is in its death throes. I wince at the crusty layer of dust and hair caking the windowsills and lining the baseboards. I wince at the realization that ultimately we will all return to dust, regardless of how hard we flail and gnash our teeth. That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop. I click together the easy to assemble rods and get right to the almost hypnotic ritual of cleansing which grants me some illusion of control, some semblance of order. I breathe deep the dust kicked up out of corners and swirling in the air. It burns my nose and the back of my throat. It reminds me that I should neither fight nor acquiesce to the interminable void. It reminds me that I should take this little ball of entropy we call life and claim it as my own. All-in-all it's great.

The wet cloth was difficult to open so I used a pair of scissors. The dry cloths grab up a lot of nasty dust and crud. It's best to use the Swiffer wet and/or dry cloths fairly regularly since neither does a great job cleaning up really dirty floors. This is my second kit now. While the handle for the Swiffer is sturdy, it is meant only for sweeping. I tried to use the Swiffer for banging against a heating vent to let my neighbors downstairs know they were making a racket, and the handle broke.

I needed something and thought the Swiffer would help. Their wet pads just pushed dirt all over, left dirt lines and didn't even clean around the grout lines even though I went through the area first with the dry pads for dirt. I would go through ~10 wet pads to \"clean\" my floors plus I would then have to go over the entire floor with my mircofiber towels. That did the job so I thought if I can replace their pads with a microfiber pads, it might work so I went on Amazon and found a microfiber cleaning pad, Tersano cleaning cloths and they fit the Swiffer head snuggly, not the XL. It works!!! I don't have to continuously buy the chemical or dry pads to fill our landfills. The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts. The investment in the Tersano pads was ~$6.00 and the original Swiffer starter kit was ~$11; not bad considering a typical sponge mop is ~$18 and are horrible on tile.

Before finding the Swiffer, I had to lug the vacuum around and use the extension to suck all the fur off of my hardwood floors - and that didn't even pick up most of the hair. Now, I use the Swiffer twice a week and my floors are hair-free. Granted, the pads tend to fill with hair quickly, and I end up going through two each time I clean the house. To extend their life, I pick large clumps of hair off the pad as I go and use both sides of each pad as well. They're also great for dusting (no cleaning solutions required), and sometimes I'll use the pads for light dusting and then clean the floors with them. The Swiffer is great for cleaning those hard-to-reach places, too - especially under the bed.

I finally gave in and bought the mop, as well as a package of dry and wet cloths since P&G generously included only 1 of each. The wet pads fall off the mop constantly after just one swipe across the floor, it's impossible to even use them at all. I can't believe they would even sell a map with a clipping mechanism that is so weak. I also don't like that I have to touch the wet pads with my hands to try to get the chintzy plastic clips to hold the pad to the mop. It's awkward and I don't know what chemicals they put in these. My mop was defective and the extension button does not work. The wet pads leave my floor sticky. The dry pads just push dirt and dust around without actually picking any of it up.

How convenient for them.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

Haven't tryed the sweep and vac, but I figure it would be a better option for sweeping."]}, {"Username":["Nicole Martinez \"Reviews by Cole\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I remember some years ago when the Swiffer came out and was being marketed by Tupperware; it seemed really cool and futuristic and it still does! The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you. However, for me, this lightweight sweeper is a great supplement (and possibly) replacement which makes sweeping and mopping quick, easy and hassle free! I would definitely recommend this to anyone sick of the broom and mop method!"]}, {"Username":["Pen Name"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I bought this item mainly for an apartment kitchen and bathroom.

As if shaken from a dream or a bad marriage, I suddenly notice the clutter I've been cohabiting with for a better part of a month. The grayish tint to the floorboards become less homey and more derelict. The odd smell begins to resemble something disturbingly close to rotting flesh. Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life. I start rummaging through the mess, assessing the damage. \"Wow, this trash is really piling up\", \"This window is full of cobwebs\", and \"I guess I own a cat.\" I start to view my very existence in a new light. I am no longer an adorable, up and coming, independent yuppie with my whole life in front of me. I am now a directionless, confused manchild with dangerously low self-esteem and whose college-aged idealism is in its death throes. I wince at the crusty layer of dust and hair caking the windowsills and lining the baseboards. I wince at the realization that ultimately we will all return to dust, regardless of how hard we flail and gnash our teeth. That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop. I click together the easy to assemble rods and get right to the almost hypnotic ritual of cleansing which grants me some illusion of control, some semblance of order. I breathe deep the dust kicked up out of corners and swirling in the air. It burns my nose and the back of my throat. It reminds me that I should neither fight nor acquiesce to the interminable void. It reminds me that I should take this little ball of entropy we call life and claim it as my own. All-in-all it's great.

I ended up just using my normal mop since I could clean the floor better with it. The whole point of the swiffer is that I don't have to get out the pine sol and fill up the sink and make a mess, but this swiffer does not do that due to the cheaply made included mop. Just keep your real mop nearby if you decide to purchase this kit since I know you will go back or get a real kit at wally world.

I needed something and thought the Swiffer would help. Their wet pads just pushed dirt all over, left dirt lines and didn't even clean around the grout lines even though I went through the area first with the dry pads for dirt. I would go through ~10 wet pads to \"clean\" my floors plus I would then have to go over the entire floor with my mircofiber towels. That did the job so I thought if I can replace their pads with a microfiber pads, it might work so I went on Amazon and found a microfiber cleaning pad, Tersano cleaning cloths and they fit the Swiffer head snuggly, not the XL. It works!!! I don't have to continuously buy the chemical or dry pads to fill our landfills. The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts. The investment in the Tersano pads was ~$6.00 and the original Swiffer starter kit was ~$11; not bad considering a typical sponge mop is ~$18 and are horrible on tile.

Before finding the Swiffer, I had to lug the vacuum around and use the extension to suck all the fur off of my hardwood floors - and that didn't even pick up most of the hair. Now, I use the Swiffer twice a week and my floors are hair-free. Granted, the pads tend to fill with hair quickly, and I end up going through two each time I clean the house. To extend their life, I pick large clumps of hair off the pad as I go and use both sides of each pad as well. They're also great for dusting (no cleaning solutions required), and sometimes I'll use the pads for light dusting and then clean the floors with them. The Swiffer is great for cleaning those hard-to-reach places, too - especially under the bed.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop.

I would go through ~10 wet pads to \"clean\" my floors plus I would then have to go over the entire floor with my mircofiber towels. That did the job so I thought if I can replace their pads with a microfiber pads, it might work so I went on Amazon and found a microfiber cleaning pad, Tersano cleaning cloths and they fit the Swiffer head snuggly, not the XL. It works!!! I don't have to continuously buy the chemical or dry pads to fill our landfills. The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts. The investment in the Tersano pads was ~$6.00 and the original Swiffer starter kit was ~$11; not bad considering a typical sponge mop is ~$18 and are horrible on tile.

Before finding the Swiffer, I had to lug the vacuum around and use the extension to suck all the fur off of my hardwood floors - and that didn't even pick up most of the hair. Now, I use the Swiffer twice a week and my floors are hair-free. Granted, the pads tend to fill with hair quickly, and I end up going through two each time I clean the house. To extend their life, I pick large clumps of hair off the pad as I go and use both sides of each pad as well. They're also great for dusting (no cleaning solutions required), and sometimes I'll use the pads for light dusting and then clean the floors with them. The Swiffer is great for cleaning those hard-to-reach places, too - especially under the bed.

I finally gave in and bought the mop, as well as a package of dry and wet cloths since P&G generously included only 1 of each. The wet pads fall off the mop constantly after just one swipe across the floor, it's impossible to even use them at all. I can't believe they would even sell a map with a clipping mechanism that is so weak. I also don't like that I have to touch the wet pads with my hands to try to get the chintzy plastic clips to hold the pad to the mop. It's awkward and I don't know what chemicals they put in these. My mop was defective and the extension button does not work. The wet pads leave my floor sticky. The dry pads just push dirt and dust around without actually picking any of it up.

How convenient for them. I am never trusting this company again."]}, {"Username":["Ali Julia"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I have been using Swiffer Sweeper for many years and just purchased a new one. The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you. However, for me, this lightweight sweeper is a great supplement (and possibly) replacement which makes sweeping and mopping quick, easy and hassle free!

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you. However, for me, this lightweight sweeper is a great supplement (and possibly) replacement which makes sweeping and mopping quick, easy and hassle free! I would definitely recommend this to anyone sick of the broom and mop method!"]}, {"Username":["Pen Name"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I bought this item mainly for an apartment kitchen and bathroom.

As if shaken from a dream or a bad marriage, I suddenly notice the clutter I've been cohabiting with for a better part of a month. The grayish tint to the floorboards become less homey and more derelict. The odd smell begins to resemble something disturbingly close to rotting flesh. Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life. I start rummaging through the mess, assessing the damage. \"Wow, this trash is really piling up\", \"This window is full of cobwebs\", and \"I guess I own a cat.\" I start to view my very existence in a new light. I am no longer an adorable, up and coming, independent yuppie with my whole life in front of me. I am now a directionless, confused manchild with dangerously low self-esteem and whose college-aged idealism is in its death throes. I wince at the crusty layer of dust and hair caking the windowsills and lining the baseboards. I wince at the realization that ultimately we will all return to dust, regardless of how hard we flail and gnash our teeth. That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop. I click together the easy to assemble rods and get right to the almost hypnotic ritual of cleansing which grants me some illusion of control, some semblance of order. I breathe deep the dust kicked up out of corners and swirling in the air. It burns my nose and the back of my throat. It reminds me that I should neither fight nor acquiesce to the interminable void. It reminds me that I should take this little ball of entropy we call life and claim it as my own. All-in-all it's great.

I can't tell that it's one bit easier than using a sponge-mop & a bucket; maybe even less so, but it's such an unpleasant job that it's like debating which kind of root canal is best. OTOH: 1. With the swiffer, you could clean a small portion of the floor at a time, & not fill a bucket with cleaner & water, & then have to dispose of it. 2.

So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you. However, for me, this lightweight sweeper is a great supplement (and possibly) replacement which makes sweeping and mopping quick, easy and hassle free! I would definitely recommend this to anyone sick of the broom and mop method!"]}, {"Username":["Pen Name"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I bought this item mainly for an apartment kitchen and bathroom.

As if shaken from a dream or a bad marriage, I suddenly notice the clutter I've been cohabiting with for a better part of a month. The grayish tint to the floorboards become less homey and more derelict. The odd smell begins to resemble something disturbingly close to rotting flesh. Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life. I start rummaging through the mess, assessing the damage. \"Wow, this trash is really piling up\", \"This window is full of cobwebs\", and \"I guess I own a cat.\" I start to view my very existence in a new light. I am no longer an adorable, up and coming, independent yuppie with my whole life in front of me. I am now a directionless, confused manchild with dangerously low self-esteem and whose college-aged idealism is in its death throes. I wince at the crusty layer of dust and hair caking the windowsills and lining the baseboards. I wince at the realization that ultimately we will all return to dust, regardless of how hard we flail and gnash our teeth. That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop. I click together the easy to assemble rods and get right to the almost hypnotic ritual of cleansing which grants me some illusion of control, some semblance of order. I breathe deep the dust kicked up out of corners and swirling in the air. It burns my nose and the back of my throat. It reminds me that I should neither fight nor acquiesce to the interminable void. It reminds me that I should take this little ball of entropy we call life and claim it as my own. All-in-all it's great.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor.

As if shaken from a dream or a bad marriage, I suddenly notice the clutter I've been cohabiting with for a better part of a month. The grayish tint to the floorboards become less homey and more derelict. The odd smell begins to resemble something disturbingly close to rotting flesh. Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life. I start rummaging through the mess, assessing the damage. \"Wow, this trash is really piling up\", \"This window is full of cobwebs\", and \"I guess I own a cat.\" I start to view my very existence in a new light. I am no longer an adorable, up and coming, independent yuppie with my whole life in front of me. I am now a directionless, confused manchild with dangerously low self-esteem and whose college-aged idealism is in its death throes. I wince at the crusty layer of dust and hair caking the windowsills and lining the baseboards. I wince at the realization that ultimately we will all return to dust, regardless of how hard we flail and gnash our teeth. That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop. I click together the easy to assemble rods and get right to the almost hypnotic ritual of cleansing which grants me some illusion of control, some semblance of order. I breathe deep the dust kicked up out of corners and swirling in the air. It burns my nose and the back of my throat. It reminds me that I should neither fight nor acquiesce to the interminable void.

The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out.

I can't tell that it's one bit easier than using a sponge-mop & a bucket; maybe even less so, but it's such an unpleasant job that it's like debating which kind of root canal is best. OTOH: 1. With the swiffer, you could clean a small portion of the floor at a time, & not fill a bucket with cleaner & water, & then have to dispose of it. 2.

It works!!! I don't have to continuously buy the chemical or dry pads to fill our landfills. The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you.

I can't tell that it's one bit easier than using a sponge-mop & a bucket; maybe even less so, but it's such an unpleasant job that it's like debating which kind of root canal is best. OTOH: 1. With the swiffer, you could clean a small portion of the floor at a time, & not fill a bucket with cleaner & water, & then have to dispose of it. 2.

The wet wipes are easy to install, just press in the corners to the slots and put the Swiffer down on the ground and just mop. Make sure the cloth doesn't get dry, because when it does it's not really going to do much cleaning.

I would go through ~10 wet pads to \"clean\" my floors plus I would then have to go over the entire floor with my mircofiber towels. That did the job so I thought if I can replace their pads with a microfiber pads, it might work so I went on Amazon and found a microfiber cleaning pad, Tersano cleaning cloths and they fit the Swiffer head snuggly, not the XL. It works!!! I don't have to continuously buy the chemical or dry pads to fill our landfills. The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you.

As if shaken from a dream or a bad marriage, I suddenly notice the clutter I've been cohabiting with for a better part of a month.

Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life.

That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop. I click together the easy to assemble rods and get right to the almost hypnotic ritual of cleansing which grants me some illusion of control, some semblance of order.

It's a small kitchen, maybe 7\"x8\", but there's always so much cleaning--& yardwork-- to do inside & out of my old s.f. house that I somehow avoid mopping the kitchen floor like the plague. (I do vacuum, & \"spot clean\" the kitchen floor ). Anyway, I'd had the bucket, & sponge-mop sitting in the kitchen for too long--w/o doing the job of course--& when I went to my local \"warehouse club\" & they had a great deal on the dry, & wet, refills for this thing, I bought them. (I then had to go to another store to buy the actual \"starter kit\" with the handle, go figure). Today I started using the wet pads to clean the kitchen floor (after vaccuming). Right now, I'm about 2 hours in to it, & have used maybe 6 of the wet pads. I can't tell that it's one bit easier than using a sponge-mop & a bucket; maybe even less so, but it's such an unpleasant job that it's like debating which kind of root canal is best. OTOH: 1. With the swiffer, you could clean a small portion of the floor at a time, & not fill a bucket with cleaner & water, & then have to dispose of it. 2. If you lived in a condo, the swiffer items would take up less space. 3. \"normal people\" who mop their kitchen floors on a regular basis might find the swiffer more time-effective. 4.

I live in a small apartment with spaces in the wood floor that catch everything and there is also construction going on outside our building that brings in a ton of dust and fiber. No matter how many times I sweep and mop, some hair and fibers manage to escape the broom and mop. The dry pad on the swiffer caught the hair and fibers, and I felt for once that the floors were actually clean, and my apartment feels much more livable. I would recommend this product for anyone with a similar problem cleaning hair and fibers. This is also a great timesaver, especially for cleaning bathroom floors and quick sweep jobs on hard floors. The swiffer is very lightweight and hardly feels like cleaning.

The same exact Swiffer that you see in the commercials and in stores. It's not your profession tile/wood cleaner, but for quick wet mopping the floor, it does it's job well. The wet wipes are easy to install, just press in the corners to the slots and put the Swiffer down on the ground and just mop. Make sure the cloth doesn't get dry, because when it does it's not really going to do much cleaning.

Their wet pads just pushed dirt all over, left dirt lines and didn't even clean around the grout lines even though I went through the area first with the dry pads for dirt. I would go through ~10 wet pads to \"clean\" my floors plus I would then have to go over the entire floor with my mircofiber towels. That did the job so I thought if I can replace their pads with a microfiber pads, it might work so I went on Amazon and found a microfiber cleaning pad, Tersano cleaning cloths and they fit the Swiffer head snuggly, not the XL. It works!!! I don't have to continuously buy the chemical or dry pads to fill our landfills. The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts.

To extend their life, I pick large clumps of hair off the pad as I go and use both sides of each pad as well. They're also great for dusting (no cleaning solutions required), and sometimes I'll use the pads for light dusting and then clean the floors with them. The Swiffer is great for cleaning those hard-to-reach places, too - especially under the bed.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you.

As if shaken from a dream or a bad marriage, I suddenly notice the clutter I've been cohabiting with for a better part of a month.

Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life.

I wince at the realization that ultimately we will all return to dust, regardless of how hard we flail and gnash our teeth. That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop. I click together the easy to assemble rods and get right to the almost hypnotic ritual of cleansing which grants me some illusion of control, some semblance of order.

I live in a small apartment with spaces in the wood floor that catch everything and there is also construction going on outside our building that brings in a ton of dust and fiber. No matter how many times I sweep and mop, some hair and fibers manage to escape the broom and mop. The dry pad on the swiffer caught the hair and fibers, and I felt for once that the floors were actually clean, and my apartment feels much more livable. I would recommend this product for anyone with a similar problem cleaning hair and fibers. This is also a great timesaver, especially for cleaning bathroom floors and quick sweep jobs on hard floors. The swiffer is very lightweight and hardly feels like cleaning. However, unless you use it very regularly, I think that an actual sweep job might occasionally be necessary, as the swiffer does not have a dust pan, but binds the dirt to its pad."]}, {"Username":["KaraKittie"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I love Swiffer and this is the first product of theirs I actually bought.

The same exact Swiffer that you see in the commercials and in stores. It's not your profession tile/wood cleaner, but for quick wet mopping the floor, it does it's job well. The wet wipes are easy to install, just press in the corners to the slots and put the Swiffer down on the ground and just mop. Make sure the cloth doesn't get dry, because when it does it's not really going to do much cleaning. Now you may want to actually use a dry micro fiber cloth to dry up the wetness instead of letting it air dry. This prevents water spots if you have wood panels/tiles that you can see.

It's best to use the Swiffer wet and/or dry cloths fairly regularly since neither does a great job cleaning up really dirty floors. This is my second kit now. While the handle for the Swiffer is sturdy, it is meant only for sweeping. I tried to use the Swiffer for banging against a heating vent to let my neighbors downstairs know they were making a racket, and the handle broke.

I needed something and thought the Swiffer would help. Their wet pads just pushed dirt all over, left dirt lines and didn't even clean around the grout lines even though I went through the area first with the dry pads for dirt. I would go through ~10 wet pads to \"clean\" my floors plus I would then have to go over the entire floor with my mircofiber towels. That did the job so I thought if I can replace their pads with a microfiber pads, it might work so I went on Amazon and found a microfiber cleaning pad, Tersano cleaning cloths and they fit the Swiffer head snuggly, not the XL. It works!!! I don't have to continuously buy the chemical or dry pads to fill our landfills. The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts. The investment in the Tersano pads was ~$6.00 and the original Swiffer starter kit was ~$11; not bad considering a typical sponge mop is ~$18 and are horrible on tile.

To extend their life, I pick large clumps of hair off the pad as I go and use both sides of each pad as well. They're also great for dusting (no cleaning solutions required), and sometimes I'll use the pads for light dusting and then clean the floors with them.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you.

Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life.

That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop.

I live in a small apartment with spaces in the wood floor that catch everything and there is also construction going on outside our building that brings in a ton of dust and fiber. No matter how many times I sweep and mop, some hair and fibers manage to escape the broom and mop. The dry pad on the swiffer caught the hair and fibers, and I felt for once that the floors were actually clean, and my apartment feels much more livable. I would recommend this product for anyone with a similar problem cleaning hair and fibers. This is also a great timesaver, especially for cleaning bathroom floors and quick sweep jobs on hard floors. The swiffer is very lightweight and hardly feels like cleaning. However, unless you use it very regularly, I think that an actual sweep job might occasionally be necessary, as the swiffer does not have a dust pan, but binds the dirt to its pad."]}, {"Username":["KaraKittie"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I love Swiffer and this is the first product of theirs I actually bought.

The same exact Swiffer that you see in the commercials and in stores. It's not your profession tile/wood cleaner, but for quick wet mopping the floor, it does it's job well. The wet wipes are easy to install, just press in the corners to the slots and put the Swiffer down on the ground and just mop. Make sure the cloth doesn't get dry, because when it does it's not really going to do much cleaning. Now you may want to actually use a dry micro fiber cloth to dry up the wetness instead of letting it air dry. This prevents water spots if you have wood panels/tiles that you can see.

It's best to use the Swiffer wet and/or dry cloths fairly regularly since neither does a great job cleaning up really dirty floors. This is my second kit now. While the handle for the Swiffer is sturdy, it is meant only for sweeping. I tried to use the Swiffer for banging against a heating vent to let my neighbors downstairs know they were making a racket, and the handle broke.

I needed something and thought the Swiffer would help. Their wet pads just pushed dirt all over, left dirt lines and didn't even clean around the grout lines even though I went through the area first with the dry pads for dirt. I would go through ~10 wet pads to \"clean\" my floors plus I would then have to go over the entire floor with my mircofiber towels. That did the job so I thought if I can replace their pads with a microfiber pads, it might work so I went on Amazon and found a microfiber cleaning pad, Tersano cleaning cloths and they fit the Swiffer head snuggly, not the XL. It works!!! I don't have to continuously buy the chemical or dry pads to fill our landfills. The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts. The investment in the Tersano pads was ~$6.00 and the original Swiffer starter kit was ~$11; not bad considering a typical sponge mop is ~$18 and are horrible on tile.

To extend their life, I pick large clumps of hair off the pad as I go and use both sides of each pad as well.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you.

Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life.

That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop. I click together the easy to assemble rods and get right to the almost hypnotic ritual of cleansing which grants me some illusion of control, some semblance of order.

I live in a small apartment with spaces in the wood floor that catch everything and there is also construction going on outside our building that brings in a ton of dust and fiber. No matter how many times I sweep and mop, some hair and fibers manage to escape the broom and mop. The dry pad on the swiffer caught the hair and fibers, and I felt for once that the floors were actually clean, and my apartment feels much more livable. I would recommend this product for anyone with a similar problem cleaning hair and fibers. This is also a great timesaver, especially for cleaning bathroom floors and quick sweep jobs on hard floors. The swiffer is very lightweight and hardly feels like cleaning. However, unless you use it very regularly, I think that an actual sweep job might occasionally be necessary, as the swiffer does not have a dust pan, but binds the dirt to its pad."]}, {"Username":["KaraKittie"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I love Swiffer and this is the first product of theirs I actually bought.

The same exact Swiffer that you see in the commercials and in stores. It's not your profession tile/wood cleaner, but for quick wet mopping the floor, it does it's job well. The wet wipes are easy to install, just press in the corners to the slots and put the Swiffer down on the ground and just mop. Make sure the cloth doesn't get dry, because when it does it's not really going to do much cleaning. Now you may want to actually use a dry micro fiber cloth to dry up the wetness instead of letting it air dry. This prevents water spots if you have wood panels/tiles that you can see.

Swiffer is good for collecting dust bunnies, pet hair and the like, but not so good for dirt such as that which comes off the feet of people and pets coming in the house.

I would go through ~10 wet pads to \"clean\" my floors plus I would then have to go over the entire floor with my mircofiber towels. That did the job so I thought if I can replace their pads with a microfiber pads, it might work so I went on Amazon and found a microfiber cleaning pad, Tersano cleaning cloths and they fit the Swiffer head snuggly, not the XL. It works!!! I don't have to continuously buy the chemical or dry pads to fill our landfills. The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts.

To extend their life, I pick large clumps of hair off the pad as I go and use both sides of each pad as well.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you.

I live in a small apartment with spaces in the wood floor that catch everything and there is also construction going on outside our building that brings in a ton of dust and fiber. No matter how many times I sweep and mop, some hair and fibers manage to escape the broom and mop. The dry pad on the swiffer caught the hair and fibers, and I felt for once that the floors were actually clean, and my apartment feels much more livable. I would recommend this product for anyone with a similar problem cleaning hair and fibers. This is also a great timesaver, especially for cleaning bathroom floors and quick sweep jobs on hard floors. The swiffer is very lightweight and hardly feels like cleaning. However, unless you use it very regularly, I think that an actual sweep job might occasionally be necessary, as the swiffer does not have a dust pan, but binds the dirt to its pad."]}, {"Username":["KaraKittie"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I love Swiffer and this is the first product of theirs I actually bought. It's nice, the kit comes with two dry \"broom\" pads and two wet \"mop\" pads. The broom pads are like magic! I love them, but my only problem is that for bigger messes or a larger area, you'll want to spot sweep most of the bigger 'chunks' before using it. It's great for hard to reach places, like under the furnaces or around the toilet. I knocked off a star for packaging. I did order this online with a few other items and qualified for free shipping, which usually means poorer packaging to begin with. The item was poking through the box a good foot and a half!

The same exact Swiffer that you see in the commercials and in stores. It's not your profession tile/wood cleaner, but for quick wet mopping the floor, it does it's job well. The wet wipes are easy to install, just press in the corners to the slots and put the Swiffer down on the ground and just mop. Make sure the cloth doesn't get dry, because when it does it's not really going to do much cleaning. Now you may want to actually use a dry micro fiber cloth to dry up the wetness instead of letting it air dry. This prevents water spots if you have wood panels/tiles that you can see.

I think the criticism about the swiffer really belongs to the separate pads or wipes you have to buy. The actual sweeper is okay overall. I have not experienced any breakage myself nor does it feel prone to breakage. However, I have seen this complaint come up while reading other reviews so I feel like it should be acknowledged. Overall, it feels a little less sturdy than I immediately anticipated, but not close to feeling to \"flimsy\". Anyways, a lot of people have complained about the swiffer just pushing dirt around and I would say this is somewhat true. You definitely need to sweep first before using the wet wipes. The cloth wipes worked really well for sweeping up dust, hair and dirt. The wet pads seem to just add a nice shine to the floor. They definitely pick up more grime, but I don't know how deep cleaning this product is. It seems to be like a quick fix tool. You can make your kitchen floor look presentable in about 5 or 10 minutes, but Im not sure if its better than using something like pine sole. I live in an incredibly small apartment in Asia which is 100% hard wood flooring except the bathroom of course. The swiffer wet pads seem to have an incredibly short life to them. They are very wet in the package but after only a few passes along the floor, they seem to lose over half of their wetness at least. My apartment is literally just one room with a slider door separating the one room from the kitchen. I managed to get my kitchen floor done with one swiffer. However, I had to use multiple wet pads just to clean one half of my one room apartment. That is really just not very good. I have read about people using both sides of the pad. I haven't tried that yet so I'm not sure if it works. Overall, I think the problem is with the wet pads not lasting as long as I would like. This tool is a lazy man's dream. It is still a very easy and valuable cleaning tool, but the pads just don't last very long. I will be on the lookout for other brands I suppose."]}]

It's best to use the Swiffer wet and/or dry cloths fairly regularly since neither does a great job cleaning up really dirty floors. This is my second kit now.

I tried to use the Swiffer for banging against a heating vent to let my neighbors downstairs know they were making a racket, and the handle broke.

I needed something and thought the Swiffer would help. Their wet pads just pushed dirt all over, left dirt lines and didn't even clean around the grout lines even though I went through the area first with the dry pads for dirt. I would go through ~10 wet pads to \"clean\" my floors plus I would then have to go over the entire floor with my mircofiber towels. That did the job so I thought if I can replace their pads with a microfiber pads, it might work so I went on Amazon and found a microfiber cleaning pad, Tersano cleaning cloths and they fit the Swiffer head snuggly, not the XL. It works!!! I don't have to continuously buy the chemical or dry pads to fill our landfills. The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts. The investment in the Tersano pads was ~$6.00 and the original Swiffer starter kit was ~$11; not bad considering a typical sponge mop is ~$18 and are horrible on tile.

To extend their life, I pick large clumps of hair off the pad as I go and use both sides of each pad as well. They're also great for dusting (no cleaning solutions required), and sometimes I'll use the pads for light dusting and then clean the floors with them. The Swiffer is great for cleaning those hard-to-reach places, too - especially under the bed.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you.

It's a small kitchen, maybe 7\"x8\", but there's always so much cleaning--& yardwork-- to do inside & out of my old s.f. house that I somehow avoid mopping the kitchen floor like the plague.

I can't tell that it's one bit easier than using a sponge-mop & a bucket; maybe even less so, but it's such an unpleasant job that it's like debating which kind of root canal is best. OTOH: 1. With the swiffer, you could clean a small portion of the floor at a time, & not fill a bucket with cleaner & water, & then have to dispose of it. 2. If you lived in a condo, the swiffer items would take up less space. 3. \"normal people\" who mop their kitchen floors on a regular basis might find the swiffer more time-effective. 4.

I live in a small apartment with spaces in the wood floor that catch everything and there is also construction going on outside our building that brings in a ton of dust and fiber. No matter how many times I sweep and mop, some hair and fibers manage to escape the broom and mop. The dry pad on the swiffer caught the hair and fibers, and I felt for once that the floors were actually clean, and my apartment feels much more livable. I would recommend this product for anyone with a similar problem cleaning hair and fibers. This is also a great timesaver, especially for cleaning bathroom floors and quick sweep jobs on hard floors. The swiffer is very lightweight and hardly feels like cleaning.

The wet wipes are easy to install, just press in the corners to the slots and put the Swiffer down on the ground and just mop. Make sure the cloth doesn't get dry, because when it does it's not really going to do much cleaning.

I think the criticism about the swiffer really belongs to the separate pads or wipes you have to buy. The actual sweeper is okay overall. I have not experienced any breakage myself nor does it feel prone to breakage. However, I have seen this complaint come up while reading other reviews so I feel like it should be acknowledged. Overall, it feels a little less sturdy than I immediately anticipated, but not close to feeling to \"flimsy\". Anyways, a lot of people have complained about the swiffer just pushing dirt around and I would say this is somewhat true. You definitely need to sweep first before using the wet wipes. The cloth wipes worked really well for sweeping up dust, hair and dirt. The wet pads seem to just add a nice shine to the floor. They definitely pick up more grime, but I don't know how deep cleaning this product is. It seems to be like a quick fix tool. You can make your kitchen floor look presentable in about 5 or 10 minutes, but Im not sure if its better than using something like pine sole. I live in an incredibly small apartment in Asia which is 100% hard wood flooring except the bathroom of course. The swiffer wet pads seem to have an incredibly short life to them. They are very wet in the package but after only a few passes along the floor, they seem to lose over half of their wetness at least. My apartment is literally just one room with a slider door separating the one room from the kitchen. I managed to get my kitchen floor done with one swiffer. However, I had to use multiple wet pads just to clean one half of my one room apartment. That is really just not very good. I have read about people using both sides of the pad. I haven't tried that yet so I'm not sure if it works. Overall, I think the problem is with the wet pads not lasting as long as I would like. This tool is a lazy man's dream. It is still a very easy and valuable cleaning tool, but the pads just don't last very long.

It works!!! I don't have to continuously buy the chemical or dry pads to fill our landfills. The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you.

It's a small kitchen, maybe 7\"x8\", but there's always so much cleaning--& yardwork-- to do inside & out of my old s.f. house that I somehow avoid mopping the kitchen floor like the plague. (I do vacuum, & \"spot clean\" the kitchen floor ). Anyway, I'd had the bucket, & sponge-mop sitting in the kitchen for too long--w/o doing the job of course--& when I went to my local \"warehouse club\" & they had a great deal on the dry, & wet, refills for this thing, I bought them. (I then had to go to another store to buy the actual \"starter kit\" with the handle, go figure). Today I started using the wet pads to clean the kitchen floor (after vaccuming). Right now, I'm about 2 hours in to it, & have used maybe 6 of the wet pads. I can't tell that it's one bit easier than using a sponge-mop & a bucket; maybe even less so, but it's such an unpleasant job that it's like debating which kind of root canal is best. OTOH: 1. With the swiffer, you could clean a small portion of the floor at a time, & not fill a bucket with cleaner & water, & then have to dispose of it. 2. If you lived in a condo, the swiffer items would take up less space. 3. \"normal people\" who mop their kitchen floors on a regular basis might find the swiffer more time-effective. 4.

I would recommend this product for anyone with a similar problem cleaning hair and fibers. This is also a great timesaver, especially for cleaning bathroom floors and quick sweep jobs on hard floors.

The wet wipes are easy to install, just press in the corners to the slots and put the Swiffer down on the ground and just mop. Make sure the cloth doesn't get dry, because when it does it's not really going to do much cleaning.

I think the criticism about the swiffer really belongs to the separate pads or wipes you have to buy. The actual sweeper is okay overall. I have not experienced any breakage myself nor does it feel prone to breakage. However, I have seen this complaint come up while reading other reviews so I feel like it should be acknowledged. Overall, it feels a little less sturdy than I immediately anticipated, but not close to feeling to \"flimsy\". Anyways, a lot of people have complained about the swiffer just pushing dirt around and I would say this is somewhat true. You definitely need to sweep first before using the wet wipes. The cloth wipes worked really well for sweeping up dust, hair and dirt. The wet pads seem to just add a nice shine to the floor. They definitely pick up more grime, but I don't know how deep cleaning this product is. It seems to be like a quick fix tool. You can make your kitchen floor look presentable in about 5 or 10 minutes, but Im not sure if its better than using something like pine sole. I live in an incredibly small apartment in Asia which is 100% hard wood flooring except the bathroom of course. The swiffer wet pads seem to have an incredibly short life to them. They are very wet in the package but after only a few passes along the floor, they seem to lose over half of their wetness at least. My apartment is literally just one room with a slider door separating the one room from the kitchen. I managed to get my kitchen floor done with one swiffer. However, I had to use multiple wet pads just to clean one half of my one room apartment. That is really just not very good. I have read about people using both sides of the pad. I haven't tried that yet so I'm not sure if it works. Overall, I think the problem is with the wet pads not lasting as long as I would like. This tool is a lazy man's dream.

It works!!! I don't have to continuously buy the chemical or dry pads to fill our landfills. The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you.

Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life.

I wince at the realization that ultimately we will all return to dust, regardless of how hard we flail and gnash our teeth. That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop. I click together the easy to assemble rods and get right to the almost hypnotic ritual of cleansing which grants me some illusion of control, some semblance of order.

Anyway, I'd had the bucket, & sponge-mop sitting in the kitchen for too long--w/o doing the job of course--& when I went to my local \"warehouse club\" & they had a great deal on the dry, & wet, refills for this thing, I bought them.

I can't tell that it's one bit easier than using a sponge-mop & a bucket; maybe even less so, but it's such an unpleasant job that it's like debating which kind of root canal is best. OTOH: 1. With the swiffer, you could clean a small portion of the floor at a time, & not fill a bucket with cleaner & water, & then have to dispose of it. 2. If you lived in a condo, the swiffer items would take up less space. 3. \"normal people\" who mop their kitchen floors on a regular basis might find the swiffer more time-effective. 4.

I think the criticism about the swiffer really belongs to the separate pads or wipes you have to buy. The actual sweeper is okay overall. I have not experienced any breakage myself nor does it feel prone to breakage. However, I have seen this complaint come up while reading other reviews so I feel like it should be acknowledged. Overall, it feels a little less sturdy than I immediately anticipated, but not close to feeling to \"flimsy\". Anyways, a lot of people have complained about the swiffer just pushing dirt around and I would say this is somewhat true. You definitely need to sweep first before using the wet wipes. The cloth wipes worked really well for sweeping up dust, hair and dirt. The wet pads seem to just add a nice shine to the floor. They definitely pick up more grime, but I don't know how deep cleaning this product is. It seems to be like a quick fix tool. You can make your kitchen floor look presentable in about 5 or 10 minutes, but Im not sure if its better than using something like pine sole. I live in an incredibly small apartment in Asia which is 100% hard wood flooring except the bathroom of course. The swiffer wet pads seem to have an incredibly short life to them. They are very wet in the package but after only a few passes along the floor, they seem to lose over half of their wetness at least. My apartment is literally just one room with a slider door separating the one room from the kitchen. I managed to get my kitchen floor done with one swiffer. However, I had to use multiple wet pads just to clean one half of my one room apartment. That is really just not very good. I have read about people using both sides of the pad. I haven't tried that yet so I'm not sure if it works. Overall, I think the problem is with the wet pads not lasting as long as I would like. This tool is a lazy man's dream.

The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away.

The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you. However, for me, this lightweight sweeper is a great supplement (and possibly) replacement which makes sweeping and mopping quick, easy and hassle free! I would definitely recommend this to anyone sick of the broom and mop method!"]}, {"Username":["Pen Name"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I bought this item mainly for an apartment kitchen and bathroom.

As if shaken from a dream or a bad marriage, I suddenly notice the clutter I've been cohabiting with for a better part of a month. The grayish tint to the floorboards become less homey and more derelict. The odd smell begins to resemble something disturbingly close to rotting flesh. Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life. I start rummaging through the mess, assessing the damage. \"Wow, this trash is really piling up\", \"This window is full of cobwebs\", and \"I guess I own a cat.\" I start to view my very existence in a new light. I am no longer an adorable, up and coming, independent yuppie with my whole life in front of me. I am now a directionless, confused manchild with dangerously low self-esteem and whose college-aged idealism is in its death throes. I wince at the crusty layer of dust and hair caking the windowsills and lining the baseboards. I wince at the realization that ultimately we will all return to dust, regardless of how hard we flail and gnash our teeth. That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop. I click together the easy to assemble rods and get right to the almost hypnotic ritual of cleansing which grants me some illusion of control, some semblance of order. I breathe deep the dust kicked up out of corners and swirling in the air. It burns my nose and the back of my throat. It reminds me that I should neither fight nor acquiesce to the interminable void.

I think the criticism about the swiffer really belongs to the separate pads or wipes you have to buy. The actual sweeper is okay overall. I have not experienced any breakage myself nor does it feel prone to breakage. However, I have seen this complaint come up while reading other reviews so I feel like it should be acknowledged. Overall, it feels a little less sturdy than I immediately anticipated, but not close to feeling to \"flimsy\". Anyways, a lot of people have complained about the swiffer just pushing dirt around and I would say this is somewhat true. You definitely need to sweep first before using the wet wipes. The cloth wipes worked really well for sweeping up dust, hair and dirt. The wet pads seem to just add a nice shine to the floor. They definitely pick up more grime, but I don't know how deep cleaning this product is. It seems to be like a quick fix tool. You can make your kitchen floor look presentable in about 5 or 10 minutes, but Im not sure if its better than using something like pine sole. I live in an incredibly small apartment in Asia which is 100% hard wood flooring except the bathroom of course. The swiffer wet pads seem to have an incredibly short life to them. They are very wet in the package but after only a few passes along the floor, they seem to lose over half of their wetness at least. My apartment is literally just one room with a slider door separating the one room from the kitchen. I managed to get my kitchen floor done with one swiffer. However, I had to use multiple wet pads just to clean one half of my one room apartment. That is really just not very good. I have read about people using both sides of the pad. I haven't tried that yet so I'm not sure if it works. Overall, I think the problem is with the wet pads not lasting as long as I would like. This tool is a lazy man's dream.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you. However, for me, this lightweight sweeper is a great supplement (and possibly) replacement which makes sweeping and mopping quick, easy and hassle free! I would definitely recommend this to anyone sick of the broom and mop method!"]}, {"Username":["Pen Name"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I bought this item mainly for an apartment kitchen and bathroom.

As if shaken from a dream or a bad marriage, I suddenly notice the clutter I've been cohabiting with for a better part of a month. The grayish tint to the floorboards become less homey and more derelict. The odd smell begins to resemble something disturbingly close to rotting flesh. Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life. I start rummaging through the mess, assessing the damage. \"Wow, this trash is really piling up\", \"This window is full of cobwebs\", and \"I guess I own a cat.\" I start to view my very existence in a new light. I am no longer an adorable, up and coming, independent yuppie with my whole life in front of me. I am now a directionless, confused manchild with dangerously low self-esteem and whose college-aged idealism is in its death throes. I wince at the crusty layer of dust and hair caking the windowsills and lining the baseboards. I wince at the realization that ultimately we will all return to dust, regardless of how hard we flail and gnash our teeth. That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop. I click together the easy to assemble rods and get right to the almost hypnotic ritual of cleansing which grants me some illusion of control, some semblance of order. I breathe deep the dust kicked up out of corners and swirling in the air. It burns my nose and the back of my throat. It reminds me that I should neither fight nor acquiesce to the interminable void.

Overall, it feels a little less sturdy than I immediately anticipated, but not close to feeling to \"flimsy\". Anyways, a lot of people have complained about the swiffer just pushing dirt around and I would say this is somewhat true. You definitely need to sweep first before using the wet wipes. The cloth wipes worked really well for sweeping up dust, hair and dirt. The wet pads seem to just add a nice shine to the floor. They definitely pick up more grime, but I don't know how deep cleaning this product is. It seems to be like a quick fix tool. You can make your kitchen floor look presentable in about 5 or 10 minutes, but Im not sure if its better than using something like pine sole. I live in an incredibly small apartment in Asia which is 100% hard wood flooring except the bathroom of course. The swiffer wet pads seem to have an incredibly short life to them. They are very wet in the package but after only a few passes along the floor, they seem to lose over half of their wetness at least. My apartment is literally just one room with a slider door separating the one room from the kitchen. I managed to get my kitchen floor done with one swiffer. However, I had to use multiple wet pads just to clean one half of my one room apartment. That is really just not very good. I have read about people using both sides of the pad. I haven't tried that yet so I'm not sure if it works. Overall, I think the problem is with the wet pads not lasting as long as I would like. This tool is a lazy man's dream.

I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you. However, for me, this lightweight sweeper is a great supplement (and possibly) replacement which makes sweeping and mopping quick, easy and hassle free! I would definitely recommend this to anyone sick of the broom and mop method!"]}, {"Username":["Pen Name"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I bought this item mainly for an apartment kitchen and bathroom.

As if shaken from a dream or a bad marriage, I suddenly notice the clutter I've been cohabiting with for a better part of a month. The grayish tint to the floorboards become less homey and more derelict. The odd smell begins to resemble something disturbingly close to rotting flesh. Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life. I start rummaging through the mess, assessing the damage. \"Wow, this trash is really piling up\", \"This window is full of cobwebs\", and \"I guess I own a cat.\" I start to view my very existence in a new light. I am no longer an adorable, up and coming, independent yuppie with my whole life in front of me. I am now a directionless, confused manchild with dangerously low self-esteem and whose college-aged idealism is in its death throes. I wince at the crusty layer of dust and hair caking the windowsills and lining the baseboards. I wince at the realization that ultimately we will all return to dust, regardless of how hard we flail and gnash our teeth. That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop. I click together the easy to assemble rods and get right to the almost hypnotic ritual of cleansing which grants me some illusion of control, some semblance of order. I breathe deep the dust kicked up out of corners and swirling in the air. It burns my nose and the back of my throat. It reminds me that I should neither fight nor acquiesce to the interminable void. It reminds me that I should take this little ball of entropy we call life and claim it as my own. All-in-all it's great.

I ended up just using my normal mop since I could clean the floor better with it. The whole point of the swiffer is that I don't have to get out the pine sol and fill up the sink and make a mess, but this swiffer does not do that due to the cheaply made included mop.

Anyway, I'd had the bucket, & sponge-mop sitting in the kitchen for too long--w/o doing the job of course--& when I went to my local \"warehouse club\" & they had a great deal on the dry, & wet, refills for this thing, I bought them.

Right now, I'm about 2 hours in to it, & have used maybe 6 of the wet pads. I can't tell that it's one bit easier than using a sponge-mop & a bucket; maybe even less so, but it's such an unpleasant job that it's like debating which kind of root canal is best. OTOH: 1. With the swiffer, you could clean a small portion of the floor at a time, & not fill a bucket with cleaner & water, & then have to dispose of it. 2. If you lived in a condo, the swiffer items would take up less space. 3. \"normal people\" who mop their kitchen floors on a regular basis might find the swiffer more time-effective. 4.

I think the criticism about the swiffer really belongs to the separate pads or wipes you have to buy. The actual sweeper is okay overall. I have not experienced any breakage myself nor does it feel prone to breakage. However, I have seen this complaint come up while reading other reviews so I feel like it should be acknowledged. Overall, it feels a little less sturdy than I immediately anticipated, but not close to feeling to \"flimsy\". Anyways, a lot of people have complained about the swiffer just pushing dirt around and I would say this is somewhat true. You definitely need to sweep first before using the wet wipes. The cloth wipes worked really well for sweeping up dust, hair and dirt. The wet pads seem to just add a nice shine to the floor. They definitely pick up more grime, but I don't know how deep cleaning this product is. It seems to be like a quick fix tool. You can make your kitchen floor look presentable in about 5 or 10 minutes, but Im not sure if its better than using something like pine sole. I live in an incredibly small apartment in Asia which is 100% hard wood flooring except the bathroom of course. The swiffer wet pads seem to have an incredibly short life to them. They are very wet in the package but after only a few passes along the floor, they seem to lose over half of their wetness at least. My apartment is literally just one room with a slider door separating the one room from the kitchen. I managed to get my kitchen floor done with one swiffer. However, I had to use multiple wet pads just to clean one half of my one room apartment. That is really just not very good. I have read about people using both sides of the pad. I haven't tried that yet so I'm not sure if it works. Overall, I think the problem is with the wet pads not lasting as long as I would like. This tool is a lazy man's dream.

I tried to use the Swiffer for banging against a heating vent to let my neighbors downstairs know they were making a racket, and the handle broke. I had been using it for years and had decided to use it for something it hadn't been invented to be used for. Great kit and great product.

I needed something and thought the Swiffer would help. Their wet pads just pushed dirt all over, left dirt lines and didn't even clean around the grout lines even though I went through the area first with the dry pads for dirt. I would go through ~10 wet pads to \"clean\" my floors plus I would then have to go over the entire floor with my mircofiber towels. That did the job so I thought if I can replace their pads with a microfiber pads, it might work so I went on Amazon and found a microfiber cleaning pad, Tersano cleaning cloths and they fit the Swiffer head snuggly, not the XL. It works!!! I don't have to continuously buy the chemical or dry pads to fill our landfills. The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts. The investment in the Tersano pads was ~$6.00 and the original Swiffer starter kit was ~$11; not bad considering a typical sponge mop is ~$18 and are horrible on tile. Buy the Swiffer but don't waste money or time with their wet or dry pads."]}, {"Username":["Kelly A.

Before finding the Swiffer, I had to lug the vacuum around and use the extension to suck all the fur off of my hardwood floors - and that didn't even pick up most of the hair. Now, I use the Swiffer twice a week and my floors are hair-free. Granted, the pads tend to fill with hair quickly, and I end up going through two each time I clean the house. To extend their life, I pick large clumps of hair off the pad as I go and use both sides of each pad as well. They're also great for dusting (no cleaning solutions required), and sometimes I'll use the pads for light dusting and then clean the floors with them. The Swiffer is great for cleaning those hard-to-reach places, too - especially under the bed. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's not quite as good picking up dirt - it can tend to just push the dirt around.

I finally gave in and bought the mop, as well as a package of dry and wet cloths since P&G generously included only 1 of each. The wet pads fall off the mop constantly after just one swipe across the floor, it's impossible to even use them at all. I can't believe they would even sell a map with a clipping mechanism that is so weak. I also don't like that I have to touch the wet pads with my hands to try to get the chintzy plastic clips to hold the pad to the mop. It's awkward and I don't know what chemicals they put in these. My mop was defective and the extension button does not work. The wet pads leave my floor sticky. The dry pads just push dirt and dust around without actually picking any of it up.

How convenient for them. I am never trusting this company again."]}, {"Username":["Ali Julia"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I have been using Swiffer Sweeper for many years and just purchased a new one. The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you. However, for me, this lightweight sweeper is a great supplement (and possibly) replacement which makes sweeping and mopping quick, easy and hassle free!

As if shaken from a dream or a bad marriage, I suddenly notice the clutter I've been cohabiting with for a better part of a month. The grayish tint to the floorboards become less homey and more derelict. The odd smell begins to resemble something disturbingly close to rotting flesh. Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life. I start rummaging through the mess, assessing the damage. \"Wow, this trash is really piling up\", \"This window is full of cobwebs\", and \"I guess I own a cat.\" I start to view my very existence in a new light. I am no longer an adorable, up and coming, independent yuppie with my whole life in front of me. I am now a directionless, confused manchild with dangerously low self-esteem and whose college-aged idealism is in its death throes. I wince at the crusty layer of dust and hair caking the windowsills and lining the baseboards. I wince at the realization that ultimately we will all return to dust, regardless of how hard we flail and gnash our teeth. That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop. I click together the easy to assemble rods and get right to the almost hypnotic ritual of cleansing which grants me some illusion of control, some semblance of order. I breathe deep the dust kicked up out of corners and swirling in the air. It burns my nose and the back of my throat. It reminds me that I should neither fight nor acquiesce to the interminable void.

I think the criticism about the swiffer really belongs to the separate pads or wipes you have to buy. The actual sweeper is okay overall. I have not experienced any breakage myself nor does it feel prone to breakage. However, I have seen this complaint come up while reading other reviews so I feel like it should be acknowledged. Overall, it feels a little less sturdy than I immediately anticipated, but not close to feeling to \"flimsy\". Anyways, a lot of people have complained about the swiffer just pushing dirt around and I would say this is somewhat true. You definitely need to sweep first before using the wet wipes. The cloth wipes worked really well for sweeping up dust, hair and dirt. The wet pads seem to just add a nice shine to the floor. They definitely pick up more grime, but I don't know how deep cleaning this product is. It seems to be like a quick fix tool. You can make your kitchen floor look presentable in about 5 or 10 minutes, but Im not sure if its better than using something like pine sole. I live in an incredibly small apartment in Asia which is 100% hard wood flooring except the bathroom of course. The swiffer wet pads seem to have an incredibly short life to them. They are very wet in the package but after only a few passes along the floor, they seem to lose over half of their wetness at least. My apartment is literally just one room with a slider door separating the one room from the kitchen. I managed to get my kitchen floor done with one swiffer. However, I had to use multiple wet pads just to clean one half of my one room apartment. That is really just not very good. I have read about people using both sides of the pad. I haven't tried that yet so I'm not sure if it works. Overall, I think the problem is with the wet pads not lasting as long as I would like. This tool is a lazy man's dream.

The wet cloth was difficult to open so I used a pair of scissors. The dry cloths grab up a lot of nasty dust and crud. It's best to use the Swiffer wet and/or dry cloths fairly regularly since neither does a great job cleaning up really dirty floors. This is my second kit now. While the handle for the Swiffer is sturdy, it is meant only for sweeping. I tried to use the Swiffer for banging against a heating vent to let my neighbors downstairs know they were making a racket, and the handle broke.

I needed something and thought the Swiffer would help. Their wet pads just pushed dirt all over, left dirt lines and didn't even clean around the grout lines even though I went through the area first with the dry pads for dirt. I would go through ~10 wet pads to \"clean\" my floors plus I would then have to go over the entire floor with my mircofiber towels. That did the job so I thought if I can replace their pads with a microfiber pads, it might work so I went on Amazon and found a microfiber cleaning pad, Tersano cleaning cloths and they fit the Swiffer head snuggly, not the XL. It works!!! I don't have to continuously buy the chemical or dry pads to fill our landfills. The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts. The investment in the Tersano pads was ~$6.00 and the original Swiffer starter kit was ~$11; not bad considering a typical sponge mop is ~$18 and are horrible on tile.

Before finding the Swiffer, I had to lug the vacuum around and use the extension to suck all the fur off of my hardwood floors - and that didn't even pick up most of the hair. Now, I use the Swiffer twice a week and my floors are hair-free. Granted, the pads tend to fill with hair quickly, and I end up going through two each time I clean the house. To extend their life, I pick large clumps of hair off the pad as I go and use both sides of each pad as well. They're also great for dusting (no cleaning solutions required), and sometimes I'll use the pads for light dusting and then clean the floors with them. The Swiffer is great for cleaning those hard-to-reach places, too - especially under the bed.

I finally gave in and bought the mop, as well as a package of dry and wet cloths since P&G generously included only 1 of each. The wet pads fall off the mop constantly after just one swipe across the floor, it's impossible to even use them at all. I can't believe they would even sell a map with a clipping mechanism that is so weak. I also don't like that I have to touch the wet pads with my hands to try to get the chintzy plastic clips to hold the pad to the mop. It's awkward and I don't know what chemicals they put in these. My mop was defective and the extension button does not work. The wet pads leave my floor sticky. The dry pads just push dirt and dust around without actually picking any of it up.

How convenient for them.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you. However, for me, this lightweight sweeper is a great supplement (and possibly) replacement which makes sweeping and mopping quick, easy and hassle free!

As if shaken from a dream or a bad marriage, I suddenly notice the clutter I've been cohabiting with for a better part of a month. The grayish tint to the floorboards become less homey and more derelict. The odd smell begins to resemble something disturbingly close to rotting flesh. Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life. I start rummaging through the mess, assessing the damage. \"Wow, this trash is really piling up\", \"This window is full of cobwebs\", and \"I guess I own a cat.\" I start to view my very existence in a new light. I am no longer an adorable, up and coming, independent yuppie with my whole life in front of me. I am now a directionless, confused manchild with dangerously low self-esteem and whose college-aged idealism is in its death throes. I wince at the crusty layer of dust and hair caking the windowsills and lining the baseboards. I wince at the realization that ultimately we will all return to dust, regardless of how hard we flail and gnash our teeth. That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop. I click together the easy to assemble rods and get right to the almost hypnotic ritual of cleansing which grants me some illusion of control, some semblance of order. I breathe deep the dust kicked up out of corners and swirling in the air. It burns my nose and the back of my throat. It reminds me that I should neither fight nor acquiesce to the interminable void.

I think the criticism about the swiffer really belongs to the separate pads or wipes you have to buy. The actual sweeper is okay overall. I have not experienced any breakage myself nor does it feel prone to breakage. However, I have seen this complaint come up while reading other reviews so I feel like it should be acknowledged. Overall, it feels a little less sturdy than I immediately anticipated, but not close to feeling to \"flimsy\". Anyways, a lot of people have complained about the swiffer just pushing dirt around and I would say this is somewhat true. You definitely need to sweep first before using the wet wipes. The cloth wipes worked really well for sweeping up dust, hair and dirt. The wet pads seem to just add a nice shine to the floor. They definitely pick up more grime, but I don't know how deep cleaning this product is. It seems to be like a quick fix tool. You can make your kitchen floor look presentable in about 5 or 10 minutes, but Im not sure if its better than using something like pine sole. I live in an incredibly small apartment in Asia which is 100% hard wood flooring except the bathroom of course. The swiffer wet pads seem to have an incredibly short life to them. They are very wet in the package but after only a few passes along the floor, they seem to lose over half of their wetness at least. My apartment is literally just one room with a slider door separating the one room from the kitchen. I managed to get my kitchen floor done with one swiffer. However, I had to use multiple wet pads just to clean one half of my one room apartment. That is really just not very good. I have read about people using both sides of the pad. I haven't tried that yet so I'm not sure if it works. Overall, I think the problem is with the wet pads not lasting as long as I would like. This tool is a lazy man's dream. It is still a very easy and valuable cleaning tool, but the pads just don't last very long.

I would go through ~10 wet pads to \"clean\" my floors plus I would then have to go over the entire floor with my mircofiber towels. That did the job so I thought if I can replace their pads with a microfiber pads, it might work so I went on Amazon and found a microfiber cleaning pad, Tersano cleaning cloths and they fit the Swiffer head snuggly, not the XL. It works!!! I don't have to continuously buy the chemical or dry pads to fill our landfills. The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you.

As if shaken from a dream or a bad marriage, I suddenly notice the clutter I've been cohabiting with for a better part of a month.

Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life.

I wince at the realization that ultimately we will all return to dust, regardless of how hard we flail and gnash our teeth. That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop. I click together the easy to assemble rods and get right to the almost hypnotic ritual of cleansing which grants me some illusion of control, some semblance of order.

(I do vacuum, & \"spot clean\" the kitchen floor ). Anyway, I'd had the bucket, & sponge-mop sitting in the kitchen for too long--w/o doing the job of course--& when I went to my local \"warehouse club\" & they had a great deal on the dry, & wet, refills for this thing, I bought them. (I then had to go to another store to buy the actual \"starter kit\" with the handle, go figure). Today I started using the wet pads to clean the kitchen floor (after vaccuming). Right now, I'm about 2 hours in to it, & have used maybe 6 of the wet pads. I can't tell that it's one bit easier than using a sponge-mop & a bucket; maybe even less so, but it's such an unpleasant job that it's like debating which kind of root canal is best. OTOH: 1. With the swiffer, you could clean a small portion of the floor at a time, & not fill a bucket with cleaner & water, & then have to dispose of it. 2. If you lived in a condo, the swiffer items would take up less space. 3. \"normal people\" who mop their kitchen floors on a regular basis might find the swiffer more time-effective. 4.

I have two Swiffer Sweepers for 2500 square feet of laminate wood floors. These cloths do not work good on rough or semi-rough surfaces because they are very light/dainty and would snag. If you are going to use a \"wet\" Swiffer, I would highly recommend the heavy duty Swiffer Wet Jet instead of investing in these lightweight mop cloths.

I live in a small apartment with spaces in the wood floor that catch everything and there is also construction going on outside our building that brings in a ton of dust and fiber. No matter how many times I sweep and mop, some hair and fibers manage to escape the broom and mop. The dry pad on the swiffer caught the hair and fibers, and I felt for once that the floors were actually clean, and my apartment feels much more livable. I would recommend this product for anyone with a similar problem cleaning hair and fibers. This is also a great timesaver, especially for cleaning bathroom floors and quick sweep jobs on hard floors. The swiffer is very lightweight and hardly feels like cleaning. However, unless you use it very regularly, I think that an actual sweep job might occasionally be necessary, as the swiffer does not have a dust pan, but binds the dirt to its pad."]}, {"Username":["KaraKittie"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I love Swiffer and this is the first product of theirs I actually bought.

It's great for hard to reach places, like under the furnaces or around the toilet. I knocked off a star for packaging. I did order this online with a few other items and qualified for free shipping, which usually means poorer packaging to begin with. The item was poking through the box a good foot and a half!

The same exact Swiffer that you see in the commercials and in stores. It's not your profession tile/wood cleaner, but for quick wet mopping the floor, it does it's job well. The wet wipes are easy to install, just press in the corners to the slots and put the Swiffer down on the ground and just mop. Make sure the cloth doesn't get dry, because when it does it's not really going to do much cleaning. Now you may want to actually use a dry micro fiber cloth to dry up the wetness instead of letting it air dry. This prevents water spots if you have wood panels/tiles that you can see.

I think the criticism about the swiffer really belongs to the separate pads or wipes you have to buy. The actual sweeper is okay overall. I have not experienced any breakage myself nor does it feel prone to breakage. However, I have seen this complaint come up while reading other reviews so I feel like it should be acknowledged. Overall, it feels a little less sturdy than I immediately anticipated, but not close to feeling to \"flimsy\". Anyways, a lot of people have complained about the swiffer just pushing dirt around and I would say this is somewhat true. You definitely need to sweep first before using the wet wipes. The cloth wipes worked really well for sweeping up dust, hair and dirt. The wet pads seem to just add a nice shine to the floor. They definitely pick up more grime, but I don't know how deep cleaning this product is. It seems to be like a quick fix tool. You can make your kitchen floor look presentable in about 5 or 10 minutes, but Im not sure if its better than using something like pine sole. I live in an incredibly small apartment in Asia which is 100% hard wood flooring except the bathroom of course. The swiffer wet pads seem to have an incredibly short life to them. They are very wet in the package but after only a few passes along the floor, they seem to lose over half of their wetness at least. My apartment is literally just one room with a slider door separating the one room from the kitchen. I managed to get my kitchen floor done with one swiffer. However, I had to use multiple wet pads just to clean one half of my one room apartment. That is really just not very good. I have read about people using both sides of the pad. I haven't tried that yet so I'm not sure if it works. Overall, I think the problem is with the wet pads not lasting as long as I would like. This tool is a lazy man's dream. It is still a very easy and valuable cleaning tool, but the pads just don't last very long.

The Tersano cloth pads are washable and because it thicker and absorbent, it cleans much better and doesn't deposit dirt in the floor grouts.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you.

Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life. I start rummaging through the mess, assessing the damage. \"Wow, this trash is really piling up\", \"This window is full of cobwebs\", and \"I guess I own a cat.\" I start to view my very existence in a new light.

I wince at the realization that ultimately we will all return to dust, regardless of how hard we flail and gnash our teeth. That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop. I click together the easy to assemble rods and get right to the almost hypnotic ritual of cleansing which grants me some illusion of control, some semblance of order.

It's a small kitchen, maybe 7\"x8\", but there's always so much cleaning--& yardwork-- to do inside & out of my old s.f. house that I somehow avoid mopping the kitchen floor like the plague.

Anyway, I'd had the bucket, & sponge-mop sitting in the kitchen for too long--w/o doing the job of course--& when I went to my local \"warehouse club\" & they had a great deal on the dry, & wet, refills for this thing, I bought them.

I can't tell that it's one bit easier than using a sponge-mop & a bucket; maybe even less so, but it's such an unpleasant job that it's like debating which kind of root canal is best. OTOH: 1. With the swiffer, you could clean a small portion of the floor at a time, & not fill a bucket with cleaner & water, & then have to dispose of it. 2. If you lived in a condo, the swiffer items would take up less space. 3. \"normal people\" who mop their kitchen floors on a regular basis might find the swiffer more time-effective. 4.

I would recommend this product for anyone with a similar problem cleaning hair and fibers. This is also a great timesaver, especially for cleaning bathroom floors and quick sweep jobs on hard floors.

The wet wipes are easy to install, just press in the corners to the slots and put the Swiffer down on the ground and just mop. Make sure the cloth doesn't get dry, because when it does it's not really going to do much cleaning.

I think the criticism about the swiffer really belongs to the separate pads or wipes you have to buy. The actual sweeper is okay overall. I have not experienced any breakage myself nor does it feel prone to breakage. However, I have seen this complaint come up while reading other reviews so I feel like it should be acknowledged. Overall, it feels a little less sturdy than I immediately anticipated, but not close to feeling to \"flimsy\". Anyways, a lot of people have complained about the swiffer just pushing dirt around and I would say this is somewhat true. You definitely need to sweep first before using the wet wipes. The cloth wipes worked really well for sweeping up dust, hair and dirt. The wet pads seem to just add a nice shine to the floor. They definitely pick up more grime, but I don't know how deep cleaning this product is. It seems to be like a quick fix tool. You can make your kitchen floor look presentable in about 5 or 10 minutes, but Im not sure if its better than using something like pine sole. I live in an incredibly small apartment in Asia which is 100% hard wood flooring except the bathroom of course. The swiffer wet pads seem to have an incredibly short life to them. They are very wet in the package but after only a few passes along the floor, they seem to lose over half of their wetness at least. My apartment is literally just one room with a slider door separating the one room from the kitchen. I managed to get my kitchen floor done with one swiffer. However, I had to use multiple wet pads just to clean one half of my one room apartment. That is really just not very good. I have read about people using both sides of the pad. I haven't tried that yet so I'm not sure if it works. Overall, I think the problem is with the wet pads not lasting as long as I would like. This tool is a lazy man's dream.

The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you. However, for me, this lightweight sweeper is a great supplement (and possibly) replacement which makes sweeping and mopping quick, easy and hassle free! I would definitely recommend this to anyone sick of the broom and mop method!"]}, {"Username":["Pen Name"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I bought this item mainly for an apartment kitchen and bathroom.

As if shaken from a dream or a bad marriage, I suddenly notice the clutter I've been cohabiting with for a better part of a month. The grayish tint to the floorboards become less homey and more derelict. The odd smell begins to resemble something disturbingly close to rotting flesh. Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life. I start rummaging through the mess, assessing the damage. \"Wow, this trash is really piling up\", \"This window is full of cobwebs\", and \"I guess I own a cat.\" I start to view my very existence in a new light. I am no longer an adorable, up and coming, independent yuppie with my whole life in front of me. I am now a directionless, confused manchild with dangerously low self-esteem and whose college-aged idealism is in its death throes. I wince at the crusty layer of dust and hair caking the windowsills and lining the baseboards. I wince at the realization that ultimately we will all return to dust, regardless of how hard we flail and gnash our teeth. That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop. I click together the easy to assemble rods and get right to the almost hypnotic ritual of cleansing which grants me some illusion of control, some semblance of order. I breathe deep the dust kicked up out of corners and swirling in the air. It burns my nose and the back of my throat. It reminds me that I should neither fight nor acquiesce to the interminable void. It reminds me that I should take this little ball of entropy we call life and claim it as my own. All-in-all it's great.

The wet wipes are easy to install, just press in the corners to the slots and put the Swiffer down on the ground and just mop. Make sure the cloth doesn't get dry, because when it does it's not really going to do much cleaning.

I think the criticism about the swiffer really belongs to the separate pads or wipes you have to buy. The actual sweeper is okay overall. I have not experienced any breakage myself nor does it feel prone to breakage. However, I have seen this complaint come up while reading other reviews so I feel like it should be acknowledged. Overall, it feels a little less sturdy than I immediately anticipated, but not close to feeling to \"flimsy\". Anyways, a lot of people have complained about the swiffer just pushing dirt around and I would say this is somewhat true. You definitely need to sweep first before using the wet wipes. The cloth wipes worked really well for sweeping up dust, hair and dirt. The wet pads seem to just add a nice shine to the floor. They definitely pick up more grime, but I don't know how deep cleaning this product is. It seems to be like a quick fix tool. You can make your kitchen floor look presentable in about 5 or 10 minutes, but Im not sure if its better than using something like pine sole. I live in an incredibly small apartment in Asia which is 100% hard wood flooring except the bathroom of course. The swiffer wet pads seem to have an incredibly short life to them. They are very wet in the package but after only a few passes along the floor, they seem to lose over half of their wetness at least. My apartment is literally just one room with a slider door separating the one room from the kitchen. I managed to get my kitchen floor done with one swiffer. However, I had to use multiple wet pads just to clean one half of my one room apartment. That is really just not very good. I have read about people using both sides of the pad. I haven't tried that yet so I'm not sure if it works. Overall, I think the problem is with the wet pads not lasting as long as I would like. This tool is a lazy man's dream.

The thing is so small that you'd need at least several changes of the cloth to actually clean one room. I live by myself in a very small apartment and it couldnt even get everything clean. Not a price efficient purchase. I would have been better off with a traditional mop and broom.

How convenient for them. I am never trusting this company again."]}, {"Username":["Ali Julia"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I have been using Swiffer Sweeper for many years and just purchased a new one. The reason I purchased a new mop is that after 4 years of constant use the teeth that hold the cleaning cloth became loose and no longer hold it for the entire cleaning session, especially when I use the wet cleaning cloths which generate more friction with the floor. I noticed that P&G slightly changed the design of the mop, and this review I will describe not only the pluses and minuses of the mop but also will compare the new mop to the older model. I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review. I LIKE: ------- 1. Swiffer Sweeper is very very convenient and easy to use. The mop is very light and causes no back strain. I have had two back surgeries yet using this mop creates no strain on my back. Both wet and dry cloth attach easily and do a nice job cleaning. I usually use the dry cloth first to pick dust and hair, and then use the wet cloth for the final cleaning. The wet cloths have a nice pine smell that makes the house not only look clean by smell clean. 2. This mop has no motor so it makes no noise. I can watch TV or talk on the phone while cleaning the house. If I am talking on the phone the other person does not even know I am multi-tasking. This makes it a real timer saver! 3. The mechanism that holds the cleaning cloth is the best among different mops of this type. The plastic teeth eventually become loose, but it took several years before I could not finish the entire cleaning job without having to re-tuck the cleaning cloth. 4. The height of the mop is adjustable, so it can be shortened to storage or for use by shorter people. I DON'T LIKE: ------------- 1. The handle of the Swiffer Sweeper is thick and does not fit into my favorite broom holder Spectrum 33000 Mop And Broom Holder. At one point I switched to using a different brand mop because I could store it in the Spectrum mop holder. However the other brand mop did not hold the cloths as well as the Swiffer Sweeper, and I had to constantly re-tuck the cloths back into the slots on the sweeper head. So I went back to the Swiffer even though I could not neatly store it in the holder. Photo #1 has a picture of the old Swiffer Sweeper next to the new one. You can see how the old teeth are permanently depressed which causes them not to hold the cleaning cloth as well as they did when the mop was new. Photo #2 shows the heads of the old and the new mop next to each. You will notice that the new head is a bit wider than the old one. This made me concerned that the old cleaning cloth will not fit as well, but that concern was unwarranted. The old cloths fit the new slightly larger mop head just fine. Photo #1 shows one of the older cleaning cloth attached to the new mop. Photo #3 shows two mops next to each other. The mechanism that control the height of the new mop was tightly wrapped with red tape. It was so tightly wrapped that initially I thought it was part of the handle, but at a closer inspection I was able to remove the tape to reveal the knob that controls the length the mop. Photo #3 also shows the difference in the handles. The new mop is still too thick for my Spectrum mop holder, but now it has a big loop which can be used to hang the mop. The old mop had just a small hole which did not fit any of my hooks. I like the new design better. I am looking forward to four more years (or more!) with the new Swiffer Sweeper. I recommend it!

I was never crazy about cleaning my floors, until I learned about other products which made life much easier and more satisfying. I will NEVER go back to a Swiffer. I highly recommend instead buying a good quality mop with reusable heads/pads, depending on your floor type and cleaning needs. Some examples: - Scotch-Brite M-005 and an extra pad or two; this is excellent for dry dusting as well as for damp mopping (using a handheld spray bottle of floor cleaner) of hardwood floors - Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen mop handle with the green dust mop pad with looped fringes... EXCELLENT for dust mopping (although if you want 1 mop for both dry and damp, go with the Scotch-Brite; the Rubbermaid is better for dry, but not nearly as good for damp mopping, so the M-005 is a better all-around solution) - Libman Wonder Mop for light duty wet mopping (if you don't mind using a small bucket) - Bona or Rubbermaid Reveal spray mops (if you DO mind using a bucket) Why do I dislike the Swiffer? - Flimsy handle; feels like it will snap under pressure, and it also flexes so much that it's difficult to transmit pressure to the floor surface when you do need to (should only be occasionally) - Small width; takes much much longer to get through a room since you need more passes - Pads tend to get things stuck under them easily, and drag them around on the floor, potentially scratching it - Wet pads dry out very quickly. I can just barely get through my small kitchen on 1 pad, and of course the quality of the clean diminishes as the pad dries out. I will say the Swiffer DRY pads are actually pretty good, but you're still stuck with the small head, and it still doesn't come close to one of the choices above."]}, {"Username":["S.

The Swiffer sweeper probably cannot replace your broom because some things are just too big to be picked up, but it does a great job at picking up anything a regular broom missed so all you need is a quick, imperfect sweep and then running the Swiffer over your floor will leave it clean and bare. The swiffer is especially good for picking up hair and dust and, with hair, rather than getting stuck to broom bristles, dragging all over the floor and becoming icky, you never see it again once it sticks to the Swiffer cloth. I love the use this in my bathroom where a broom would fail to clean up the dust, lint and hair which make up the majority of the dirt on the floor. Unlike a regular broom, which you also have to clean after use (fuzz, hair and general \"ick\"), just pull off the cleaning cloth and you're done - unless, that is, you want to mop with the Sweeper and then you can put on the wet cleaning pads and mop away. Although thee sweeper is extremely light, it feels pretty durable and is also easy on my hands, unlike some brooms which leave my hands sore, with rash or marked. The Starter kit comes with the sweeper and dry and wet clothes. I'd never used a Swiffer with the wet cloths but do own the Swiffer Wet Jet. I must say, the regular old Swiffer with the wet cloths might do a better job, faster and easier! It's also easy to put together. It's common sense and you needn't even look at the directions. Just snap the metal poles together to form the handle and to attach to the sweeper part and you're done! The handle even has a hook on the end to hang up in your closet or pantry. The rooms I use my Swiffer one are pretty small: kitchen, bathroom and laundry area so one dry cloth picked up everything without a problem but the wet cloth wasn't quite enough to mop all 3. If you have larger rooms or a lot of dirt, sweeping first (or only sweeping) might be a better option for you. However, for me, this lightweight sweeper is a great supplement (and possibly) replacement which makes sweeping and mopping quick, easy and hassle free! I would definitely recommend this to anyone sick of the broom and mop method!"]}, {"Username":["Pen Name"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I bought this item mainly for an apartment kitchen and bathroom.

As if shaken from a dream or a bad marriage, I suddenly notice the clutter I've been cohabiting with for a better part of a month. The grayish tint to the floorboards become less homey and more derelict. The odd smell begins to resemble something disturbingly close to rotting flesh. Everything in the room snaps from sepia to a harsh fluorescent, casting light into every dank crevasse of my life. I start rummaging through the mess, assessing the damage. \"Wow, this trash is really piling up\", \"This window is full of cobwebs\", and \"I guess I own a cat.\" I start to view my very existence in a new light. I am no longer an adorable, up and coming, independent yuppie with my whole life in front of me. I am now a directionless, confused manchild with dangerously low self-esteem and whose college-aged idealism is in its death throes. I wince at the crusty layer of dust and hair caking the windowsills and lining the baseboards. I wince at the realization that ultimately we will all return to dust, regardless of how hard we flail and gnash our teeth. That's when I pull out my Swiffer Sweeper and solve both the conundrum of my rapidly decaying living space and my all consuming ennui in one fell swoop. I click together the easy to assemble rods and get right to the almost hypnotic ritual of cleansing which grants me some illusion of control, some semblance of order. I breathe deep the dust kicked up out of corners and swirling in the air. It burns my nose and the back of my throat. It reminds me that I should neither fight nor acquiesce to the interminable void. It reminds me that I should take this little ball of entropy we call life and claim it as my own. All-in-all it's great.

I ended up just using my normal mop since I could clean the floor better with it. The whole point of the swiffer is that I don't have to get out the pine sol and fill up the sink and make a mess, but this swiffer does not do that due to the cheaply made included mop. Just keep your real mop nearby if you decide to purchase this kit since I know you will go back or get a real kit at wally world.

Anyway, I'd had the bucket, & sponge-mop sitting in the kitchen for too long--w/o doing the job of course--& when I went to my local \"warehouse club\" & they had a great deal on the dry, & wet, refills for this thing, I bought them.

Right now, I'm about 2 hours in to it, & have used maybe 6 of the wet pads. I can't tell that it's one bit easier than using a sponge-mop & a bucket; maybe even less so, but it's such an unpleasant job that it's like debating which kind of root canal is best. OTOH: 1. With the swiffer, you could clean a small portion of the floor at a time, & not fill a bucket with cleaner & water, & then have to dispose of it. 2. If you lived in a condo, the swiffer items would take up less space. 3. \"normal people\" who mop their kitchen floors on a regular basis might find the swiffer more time-effective. 4.

I would recommend this product for anyone with a similar problem cleaning hair and fibers. This is also a great timesaver, especially for cleaning bathroom floors and quick sweep jobs on hard floors.

The wet wipes are easy to install, just press in the corners to the slots and put the Swiffer down on the ground and just mop. Make sure the cloth doesn't get dry, because when it does it's not really going to do much cleaning.

I think the criticism about the swiffer really belongs to the separate pads or wipes you have to buy. The actual sweeper is okay overall. I have not experienced any breakage myself nor does it feel prone to breakage. However, I have seen this complaint come up while reading other reviews so I feel like it should be acknowledged. Overall, it feels a little less sturdy than I immediately anticipated, but not close to feeling to \"flimsy\". Anyways, a lot of people have complained about the swiffer just pushing dirt around and I would say this is somewhat true. You definitely need to sweep first before using the wet wipes. The cloth wipes worked really well for sweeping up dust, hair and dirt. The wet pads seem to just add a nice shine to the floor. They definitely pick up more grime, but I don't know how deep cleaning this product is. It seems to be like a quick fix tool. You can make your kitchen floor look presentable in about 5 or 10 minutes, but Im not sure if its better than using something like pine sole. I live in an incredibly small apartment in Asia which is 100% hard wood flooring except the bathroom of course. The swiffer wet pads seem to have an incredibly short life to them. They are very wet in the package but after only a few passes along the floor, they seem to lose over half of their wetness at least. My apartment is literally just one room with a slider door separating the one room from the kitchen. I managed to get my kitchen floor done with one swiffer. However, I had to use multiple wet pads just to clean one half of my one room apartment. That is really just not very good. I have read about people using both sides of the pad. I haven't tried that yet so I'm not sure if it works. Overall, I think the problem is with the wet pads not lasting as long as I would like. This tool is a lazy man's dream.

I think it's pretty useless for floor cleaning, I don't trust that I get adequate pressure running this along floors (a rag under my foot does a better job), BUT it's phenomenal for running up and down walls and removing cobwebs. The cloth that it comes with does get caught at the edge of the popcorn ceiling in all the apartments I've lived in but it doesn't leave any lint. I like that you can substitute ANY rag (any relatively thin piece of fabric stretches under the bottom and tucks into the silicone flaps on the top). I don't use it very often, but especially as a short person living in apartment complexes with ridiculously stringent move-out cleaning policies, this has been a life-saver in cleaning walls."]}, {"Username":["Rachel O."],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["We just put in hard wood floors, and I was looking for a quick way to pick up pet hair. Overall it picked up the hair fine but left my floor streaky and dull looking when I used the wet pads. One thing I really dislike about the pads is that I don't want to have to touch them when I need to pull them off or put them on. The dry cloths of course didn't streak the floors, and they picked up the pet hair okay."]}]
