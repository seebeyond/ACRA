The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc). My one complaint is Battle Mode. Rather than, like the previous entries, giving you tracks made specifically for Battle Mode, in MK8 you have to battle on the same tracks that you race on, which isn't nearly as fun in my opinion."]}]

You CANNOT chat in game with your mic and headset, not even with friends. You can only chat with friends in lobbies before the race starts. You can't chat with unconfirmed friends at all. This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}]

Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}]

This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game. It is really cool to be able to race NPC's than compare your skills to real people."]}, {"Username":["K.

This game is awesome and epic all at the same time. The one thing I always like to point out that when Nintendo makes a game, they put their heart and soul into it. The graphics and music is amazing. The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games. In fact, I like how the customization of your kart and the track differences effect the outcome. Time flies when playing this game. Thank you Nintendo for making a great game!"]}]

I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry.

My one complaint is Battle Mode.

The 3DS and DS versions round out the top 3 MK. I bought it to play with my 5 year old but unfortunately he doesn't really care for this. Yet. Oh well, because I played it last night after I put him to bed and this game is awesome. Things I like: 1. The 150CC levels are more challenging than ever. You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died. I read really long fantasy books in my bedroom late at night so I would feel powerful. In high school I found I had a gift for all things involving the track. Except girls. They thought I was a jerk. Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart. This game will turn your life around...and upside down. Online is good also. Just buy it...but do it before the free game deal is up from Nintendo. Pikmin 3 was my choice.

Controls are tight, graphics are outstanding, character selection is wonderful and kart customization is better than ever. I have a few issues however - - My biggest issue is online chat. You CANNOT chat in game with your mic and headset, not even with friends. You can only chat with friends in lobbies before the race starts. You can't chat with unconfirmed friends at all. This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people. This essentially means there is no battle mode in Mario Kart 8. Because of these 2 flaws I can only give 4 stars but what really matters AKA the core racing mode gamplay is flawless and this is a must buy for any Wii U owner."]}, {"Username":["Ryan"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I purchased a wii u specifically to play mario kart 8 and I have not been disappointed.

The 3DS and DS versions round out the top 3 MK. I bought it to play with my 5 year old but unfortunately he doesn't really care for this. Yet. Oh well, because I played it last night after I put him to bed and this game is awesome. Things I like: 1. The 150CC levels are more challenging than ever. You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died. I read really long fantasy books in my bedroom late at night so I would feel powerful. In high school I found I had a gift for all things involving the track. Except girls. They thought I was a jerk. Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart.

You CANNOT chat in game with your mic and headset, not even with friends. You can only chat with friends in lobbies before the race starts. You can't chat with unconfirmed friends at all. This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

This game is awesome and epic all at the same time. The one thing I always like to point out that when Nintendo makes a game, they put their heart and soul into it. The graphics and music is amazing. The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games.

In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels. I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors.

I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry.

This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game. It is really cool to be able to race NPC's than compare your skills to real people."]}, {"Username":["K.

This game is awesome and epic all at the same time. The one thing I always like to point out that when Nintendo makes a game, they put their heart and soul into it. The graphics and music is amazing. The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games.

The graphics for this game are very well polished and the colors definitely grab your attention.

Controls are tight, graphics are outstanding, character selection is wonderful and kart customization is better than ever. I have a few issues however - - My biggest issue is online chat. You CANNOT chat in game with your mic and headset, not even with friends. You can only chat with friends in lobbies before the race starts. You can't chat with unconfirmed friends at all. This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people. This essentially means there is no battle mode in Mario Kart 8. Because of these 2 flaws I can only give 4 stars but what really matters AKA the core racing mode gamplay is flawless and this is a must buy for any Wii U owner."]}, {"Username":["Ryan"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I purchased a wii u specifically to play mario kart 8 and I have not been disappointed.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game.

For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry.

This game is awesome and epic all at the same time. The one thing I always like to point out that when Nintendo makes a game, they put their heart and soul into it. The graphics and music is amazing. The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games.

The graphics for this game are very well polished and the colors definitely grab your attention.

One being that there are bikes in this game, but better than the Wii Version because both types of vehicles are decently comparable in performance. In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels. I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors.

And 150CC mode is hard enough that it will have you playing over and over trying to earn all of the gold trophies. Plus, every Grand Prix you finish opens up new characters and vehicle mods.

I just played 12 races, and there was a MAXIMUM of one blue shell per race, And that a huge Deal for 150cc. The Good! +items balanced more, less blue shells,and other overpowered item frequency (I only tested 150cc, but should be similar on others) +Also the ability to change the item set for multi-player is great. +You get a free game with it (But the UK has a better selection) +You can customize your carts, and it offers way more unlocks +The controls feel tighter, and you can use any controller type that the WiiU supports +Great music +You can kill the blue shell! + 60 fps! The bad: -The game runs at 720p even on 1080p tv's, and it's quite noticeable on larger screen tv's, (but you get some AA as a trade off, so it's not a huge deal) --Edit: it dose not have AA (thanks Vanilla) -- -Feels a bit too much like it's predecessors, (Feels like a patched, 720p MK wii, with a few extra features) -kart customization breaks character diversity, (not really a bad thing per say, but in the past each character had his/her own advantage, not any more) -no True item switch, you can only switch on/off a group of items, (would have been better to use a SSB style toggle system -unlock descriptions? (just like the other games, it dose not tell you how to unlock character or parts, or even how close you are to an unlock) -The roster... (they filled it up with koopalings, and a metal peach, there are so many other thing they could have added) -Battle mode (what happened to fighting in arenas??) --Summary-- Overall a very fun game, It feels much less random then Mario Kart Wii, and it's a lot of fun, whether your a Mario kart fan! or have not played since mk64 or DD, You'll enjoy this game none-the-less.

[{"Username":["CynicalKiwi"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["From what I've experienced so far, this is definitely one of my favorite Mario Kart games. I daresay it bypasses even Mario Kart Wii--my previous favorite. The graphics, soundtrack, and track design are all amazing. The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc). My one complaint is Battle Mode. Rather than, like the previous entries, giving you tracks made specifically for Battle Mode, in MK8 you have to battle on the same tracks that you race on, which isn't nearly as fun in my opinion."]}, {"Username":["Dov"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["My favorite MK in the series has always been Mario Kart 64. The 3DS and DS versions round out the top 3 MK. I bought it to play with my 5 year old but unfortunately he doesn't really care for this. Yet. Oh well, because I played it last night after I put him to bed and this game is awesome. Things I like: 1. The 150CC levels are more challenging than ever. You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died.

Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart.

[{"Username":["CynicalKiwi"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["From what I've experienced so far, this is definitely one of my favorite Mario Kart games. I daresay it bypasses even Mario Kart Wii--my previous favorite. The graphics, soundtrack, and track design are all amazing. The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc). My one complaint is Battle Mode. Rather than, like the previous entries, giving you tracks made specifically for Battle Mode, in MK8 you have to battle on the same tracks that you race on, which isn't nearly as fun in my opinion."]}, {"Username":["Dov"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["My favorite MK in the series has always been Mario Kart 64. The 3DS and DS versions round out the top 3 MK. I bought it to play with my 5 year old but unfortunately he doesn't really care for this. Yet. Oh well, because I played it last night after I put him to bed and this game is awesome. Things I like: 1. The 150CC levels are more challenging than ever. You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died. I read really long fantasy books in my bedroom late at night so I would feel powerful. In high school I found I had a gift for all things involving the track. Except girls. They thought I was a jerk. Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart.

Controls are tight, graphics are outstanding, character selection is wonderful and kart customization is better than ever. I have a few issues however - - My biggest issue is online chat. You CANNOT chat in game with your mic and headset, not even with friends. You can only chat with friends in lobbies before the race starts. You can't chat with unconfirmed friends at all. This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people. This essentially means there is no battle mode in Mario Kart 8.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence.

The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good.

I daresay it bypasses even Mario Kart Wii--my previous favorite. The graphics, soundtrack, and track design are all amazing. The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc). My one complaint is Battle Mode. Rather than, like the previous entries, giving you tracks made specifically for Battle Mode, in MK8 you have to battle on the same tracks that you race on, which isn't nearly as fun in my opinion."]}, {"Username":["Dov"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["My favorite MK in the series has always been Mario Kart 64. The 3DS and DS versions round out the top 3 MK. I bought it to play with my 5 year old but unfortunately he doesn't really care for this. Yet. Oh well, because I played it last night after I put him to bed and this game is awesome. Things I like: 1. The 150CC levels are more challenging than ever. You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in. I've been playing Nintendo since the very beginning with Kung Fu and Balloon Fight the NES. Wii U is a great system and this is the best game that I've played on it to date. Its the best entry to this fantastic series!!"]}, {"Username":["Jeffrey D. Corry"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This may or may not be a work of fiction. Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died. I read really long fantasy books in my bedroom late at night so I would feel powerful. In high school I found I had a gift for all things involving the track. Except girls. They thought I was a jerk. Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart. This game will turn your life around...and upside down. Online is good also. Just buy it...but do it before the free game deal is up from Nintendo. Pikmin 3 was my choice. It is also life altering."]}, {"Username":["John Kless"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I had the choice between PS4 Watchdogs and Mario Kart 8, I chose Mario Kart. Best choice ever. Since getting it, my other systems haven't been turned on and it hasn't been removed from my Wii U. If Nintendo had this as a launch game they would have ruled this generation. The most impressive thing about the graphics are the reflection effects, especially in puddles on the tracks. The rest of the reviewers have hit on other high points."]}, {"Username":["Alex K"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["FIrst of all the core of what this game is is done very well. Controls are tight, graphics are outstanding, character selection is wonderful and kart customization is better than ever. I have a few issues however - - My biggest issue is online chat. You CANNOT chat in game with your mic and headset, not even with friends. You can only chat with friends in lobbies before the race starts. You can't chat with unconfirmed friends at all. This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people. This essentially means there is no battle mode in Mario Kart 8. Because of these 2 flaws I can only give 4 stars but what really matters AKA the core racing mode gamplay is flawless and this is a must buy for any Wii U owner."]}, {"Username":["Ryan"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I purchased a wii u specifically to play mario kart 8 and I have not been disappointed.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game. It is really cool to be able to race NPC's than compare your skills to real people."]}, {"Username":["K.

This game is awesome and epic all at the same time. The one thing I always like to point out that when Nintendo makes a game, they put their heart and soul into it. The graphics and music is amazing. The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games.

The graphics for this game are very well polished and the colors definitely grab your attention. This game feels almost exactly like Mario Kart 7, but it has it's perks compared to the 3DS Mario Kart. One being that there are bikes in this game, but better than the Wii Version because both types of vehicles are decently comparable in performance. In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels. I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors.

If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}]
[{"Username":["CynicalKiwi"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["From what I've experienced so far, this is definitely one of my favorite Mario Kart games. I daresay it bypasses even Mario Kart Wii--my previous favorite. The graphics, soundtrack, and track design are all amazing. The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc). My one complaint is Battle Mode. Rather than, like the previous entries, giving you tracks made specifically for Battle Mode, in MK8 you have to battle on the same tracks that you race on, which isn't nearly as fun in my opinion."]}, {"Username":["Dov"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["My favorite MK in the series has always been Mario Kart 64. The 3DS and DS versions round out the top 3 MK. I bought it to play with my 5 year old but unfortunately he doesn't really care for this. Yet. Oh well, because I played it last night after I put him to bed and this game is awesome. Things I like: 1. The 150CC levels are more challenging than ever. You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in. I've been playing Nintendo since the very beginning with Kung Fu and Balloon Fight the NES. Wii U is a great system and this is the best game that I've played on it to date. Its the best entry to this fantastic series!!"]}, {"Username":["Jeffrey D. Corry"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This may or may not be a work of fiction. Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died. I read really long fantasy books in my bedroom late at night so I would feel powerful. In high school I found I had a gift for all things involving the track. Except girls. They thought I was a jerk. Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart. This game will turn your life around...and upside down. Online is good also. Just buy it...but do it before the free game deal is up from Nintendo. Pikmin 3 was my choice. It is also life altering."]}, {"Username":["John Kless"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I had the choice between PS4 Watchdogs and Mario Kart 8, I chose Mario Kart. Best choice ever. Since getting it, my other systems haven't been turned on and it hasn't been removed from my Wii U. If Nintendo had this as a launch game they would have ruled this generation. The most impressive thing about the graphics are the reflection effects, especially in puddles on the tracks. The rest of the reviewers have hit on other high points."]}, {"Username":["Alex K"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["FIrst of all the core of what this game is is done very well. Controls are tight, graphics are outstanding, character selection is wonderful and kart customization is better than ever. I have a few issues however - - My biggest issue is online chat. You CANNOT chat in game with your mic and headset, not even with friends. You can only chat with friends in lobbies before the race starts. You can't chat with unconfirmed friends at all. This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people. This essentially means there is no battle mode in Mario Kart 8. Because of these 2 flaws I can only give 4 stars but what really matters AKA the core racing mode gamplay is flawless and this is a must buy for any Wii U owner."]}, {"Username":["Ryan"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I purchased a wii u specifically to play mario kart 8 and I have not been disappointed.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games.

If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10.

Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}]

I daresay it bypasses even Mario Kart Wii--my previous favorite. The graphics, soundtrack, and track design are all amazing. The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc). My one complaint is Battle Mode. Rather than, like the previous entries, giving you tracks made specifically for Battle Mode, in MK8 you have to battle on the same tracks that you race on, which isn't nearly as fun in my opinion."]}, {"Username":["Dov"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["My favorite MK in the series has always been Mario Kart 64. The 3DS and DS versions round out the top 3 MK. I bought it to play with my 5 year old but unfortunately he doesn't really care for this. Yet. Oh well, because I played it last night after I put him to bed and this game is awesome. Things I like: 1. The 150CC levels are more challenging than ever. You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died. I read really long fantasy books in my bedroom late at night so I would feel powerful. In high school I found I had a gift for all things involving the track. Except girls. They thought I was a jerk. Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart. This game will turn your life around...and upside down. Online is good also. Just buy it...but do it before the free game deal is up from Nintendo. Pikmin 3 was my choice.

The most impressive thing about the graphics are the reflection effects, especially in puddles on the tracks.

Controls are tight, graphics are outstanding, character selection is wonderful and kart customization is better than ever. I have a few issues however - - My biggest issue is online chat. You CANNOT chat in game with your mic and headset, not even with friends. You can only chat with friends in lobbies before the race starts. You can't chat with unconfirmed friends at all. This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning.

If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}]

I daresay it bypasses even Mario Kart Wii--my previous favorite. The graphics, soundtrack, and track design are all amazing. The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc). My one complaint is Battle Mode. Rather than, like the previous entries, giving you tracks made specifically for Battle Mode, in MK8 you have to battle on the same tracks that you race on, which isn't nearly as fun in my opinion."]}, {"Username":["Dov"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["My favorite MK in the series has always been Mario Kart 64. The 3DS and DS versions round out the top 3 MK. I bought it to play with my 5 year old but unfortunately he doesn't really care for this. Yet. Oh well, because I played it last night after I put him to bed and this game is awesome. Things I like: 1. The 150CC levels are more challenging than ever. You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died. I read really long fantasy books in my bedroom late at night so I would feel powerful. In high school I found I had a gift for all things involving the track. Except girls. They thought I was a jerk. Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart.

This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}]
[{"Username":["CynicalKiwi"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["From what I've experienced so far, this is definitely one of my favorite Mario Kart games. I daresay it bypasses even Mario Kart Wii--my previous favorite. The graphics, soundtrack, and track design are all amazing. The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc). My one complaint is Battle Mode. Rather than, like the previous entries, giving you tracks made specifically for Battle Mode, in MK8 you have to battle on the same tracks that you race on, which isn't nearly as fun in my opinion."]}, {"Username":["Dov"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["My favorite MK in the series has always been Mario Kart 64. The 3DS and DS versions round out the top 3 MK. I bought it to play with my 5 year old but unfortunately he doesn't really care for this. Yet. Oh well, because I played it last night after I put him to bed and this game is awesome. Things I like: 1. The 150CC levels are more challenging than ever. You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died. I read really long fantasy books in my bedroom late at night so I would feel powerful. In high school I found I had a gift for all things involving the track. Except girls. They thought I was a jerk. Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart.

This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people.

Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

This game feels almost exactly like Mario Kart 7, but it has it's perks compared to the 3DS Mario Kart. One being that there are bikes in this game, but better than the Wii Version because both types of vehicles are decently comparable in performance. In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels. I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors. All-in-all, I give Mario Kart 8 a resounding five stars, and I would most definitely recommend this to anyone that may or may not have a WiiU yet."]}, {"Username":["Cory"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["MK8 is absolutely phenomenal and Wii U is the best gaming system out there. MK8 has 32 brilliant tracks that are so rich that they're hard to master completely. Each level has so many different variables, short cuts, and strategies by the computer that you will never get bored. And 150CC mode is hard enough that it will have you playing over and over trying to earn all of the gold trophies. Plus, every Grand Prix you finish opens up new characters and vehicle mods. Lastly, Online play is fantastic and loads of fun. This game is the most beautiful game I've played, so ridiculously fun, and addicting.

I just played 12 races, and there was a MAXIMUM of one blue shell per race, And that a huge Deal for 150cc. The Good! +items balanced more, less blue shells,and other overpowered item frequency (I only tested 150cc, but should be similar on others) +Also the ability to change the item set for multi-player is great. +You get a free game with it (But the UK has a better selection) +You can customize your carts, and it offers way more unlocks +The controls feel tighter, and you can use any controller type that the WiiU supports +Great music +You can kill the blue shell! + 60 fps! The bad: -The game runs at 720p even on 1080p tv's, and it's quite noticeable on larger screen tv's, (but you get some AA as a trade off, so it's not a huge deal) --Edit: it dose not have AA (thanks Vanilla) -- -Feels a bit too much like it's predecessors, (Feels like a patched, 720p MK wii, with a few extra features) -kart customization breaks character diversity, (not really a bad thing per say, but in the past each character had his/her own advantage, not any more) -no True item switch, you can only switch on/off a group of items, (would have been better to use a SSB style toggle system -unlock descriptions? (just like the other games, it dose not tell you how to unlock character or parts, or even how close you are to an unlock) -The roster... (they filled it up with koopalings, and a metal peach, there are so many other thing they could have added) -Battle mode (what happened to fighting in arenas??) --Summary-- Overall a very fun game, It feels much less random then Mario Kart Wii, and it's a lot of fun, whether your a Mario kart fan! or have not played since mk64 or DD, You'll enjoy this game none-the-less.

Despite the fact that I have far, far fewer friends in my life that are willing to play Mario Kart with me now than I did with the N64 game, I actually think this is a better Mario Kart than any that have come before. It outranks my hyperbolic memories of yesteryear. I just wish I had more people to play it with. If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1. One of the reviews said that you can't go shopping and turtle shells represent animal abuse...But anyway, this is definitely the best mario kart game to date. First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died. I read really long fantasy books in my bedroom late at night so I would feel powerful. In high school I found I had a gift for all things involving the track. Except girls. They thought I was a jerk. Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart.

This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends.

Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

This game is awesome and epic all at the same time. The one thing I always like to point out that when Nintendo makes a game, they put their heart and soul into it. The graphics and music is amazing. The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games.

The graphics for this game are very well polished and the colors definitely grab your attention. This game feels almost exactly like Mario Kart 7, but it has it's perks compared to the 3DS Mario Kart. One being that there are bikes in this game, but better than the Wii Version because both types of vehicles are decently comparable in performance. In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels. I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors.

Despite the fact that I have far, far fewer friends in my life that are willing to play Mario Kart with me now than I did with the N64 game, I actually think this is a better Mario Kart than any that have come before. It outranks my hyperbolic memories of yesteryear. I just wish I had more people to play it with. If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1. One of the reviews said that you can't go shopping and turtle shells represent animal abuse...But anyway, this is definitely the best mario kart game to date. First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before. Regardless I can't find a single wrong thing with mario kart 8, Nintendo set out to make a show stopper to show everyone the wii u's powers, and this is just a start.

With its 30 characters, wonderful graphics, level design, and racing fun, you can't go wrong. Mario Kart 8 has all the modes that Mario Kart 7 had. Unfortunately, Mario Kart 8's Battle Mode is a huge problem using normal race tracks. It is to hard to find someone and when you do, they might as well kill you with a green shell. The new items work great. In conclusion, Mario Kart 8 is an amazing game, and I recommend it to any Wii U owner. Or if you don't have a Wii U, buy one."]}]

I daresay it bypasses even Mario Kart Wii--my previous favorite. The graphics, soundtrack, and track design are all amazing. The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc). My one complaint is Battle Mode. Rather than, like the previous entries, giving you tracks made specifically for Battle Mode, in MK8 you have to battle on the same tracks that you race on, which isn't nearly as fun in my opinion."]}, {"Username":["Dov"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["My favorite MK in the series has always been Mario Kart 64. The 3DS and DS versions round out the top 3 MK. I bought it to play with my 5 year old but unfortunately he doesn't really care for this. Yet. Oh well, because I played it last night after I put him to bed and this game is awesome. Things I like: 1. The 150CC levels are more challenging than ever. You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died. I read really long fantasy books in my bedroom late at night so I would feel powerful. In high school I found I had a gift for all things involving the track. Except girls. They thought I was a jerk. Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart. This game will turn your life around...and upside down. Online is good also. Just buy it...but do it before the free game deal is up from Nintendo. Pikmin 3 was my choice.

Controls are tight, graphics are outstanding, character selection is wonderful and kart customization is better than ever. I have a few issues however - - My biggest issue is online chat. You CANNOT chat in game with your mic and headset, not even with friends. You can only chat with friends in lobbies before the race starts. You can't chat with unconfirmed friends at all. This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1. One of the reviews said that you can't go shopping and turtle shells represent animal abuse...But anyway, this is definitely the best mario kart game to date. First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

I daresay it bypasses even Mario Kart Wii--my previous favorite. The graphics, soundtrack, and track design are all amazing. The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc). My one complaint is Battle Mode. Rather than, like the previous entries, giving you tracks made specifically for Battle Mode, in MK8 you have to battle on the same tracks that you race on, which isn't nearly as fun in my opinion."]}, {"Username":["Dov"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["My favorite MK in the series has always been Mario Kart 64. The 3DS and DS versions round out the top 3 MK. I bought it to play with my 5 year old but unfortunately he doesn't really care for this. Yet. Oh well, because I played it last night after I put him to bed and this game is awesome. Things I like: 1. The 150CC levels are more challenging than ever. You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died. I read really long fantasy books in my bedroom late at night so I would feel powerful. In high school I found I had a gift for all things involving the track. Except girls. They thought I was a jerk. Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people.

Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry.

This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors. All-in-all, I give Mario Kart 8 a resounding five stars, and I would most definitely recommend this to anyone that may or may not have a WiiU yet."]}, {"Username":["Cory"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["MK8 is absolutely phenomenal and Wii U is the best gaming system out there. MK8 has 32 brilliant tracks that are so rich that they're hard to master completely.

And 150CC mode is hard enough that it will have you playing over and over trying to earn all of the gold trophies. Plus, every Grand Prix you finish opens up new characters and vehicle mods.

I just played 12 races, and there was a MAXIMUM of one blue shell per race, And that a huge Deal for 150cc. The Good! +items balanced more, less blue shells,and other overpowered item frequency (I only tested 150cc, but should be similar on others) +Also the ability to change the item set for multi-player is great. +You get a free game with it (But the UK has a better selection) +You can customize your carts, and it offers way more unlocks +The controls feel tighter, and you can use any controller type that the WiiU supports +Great music +You can kill the blue shell! + 60 fps! The bad: -The game runs at 720p even on 1080p tv's, and it's quite noticeable on larger screen tv's, (but you get some AA as a trade off, so it's not a huge deal) --Edit: it dose not have AA (thanks Vanilla) -- -Feels a bit too much like it's predecessors, (Feels like a patched, 720p MK wii, with a few extra features) -kart customization breaks character diversity, (not really a bad thing per say, but in the past each character had his/her own advantage, not any more) -no True item switch, you can only switch on/off a group of items, (would have been better to use a SSB style toggle system -unlock descriptions? (just like the other games, it dose not tell you how to unlock character or parts, or even how close you are to an unlock) -The roster... (they filled it up with koopalings, and a metal peach, there are so many other thing they could have added) -Battle mode (what happened to fighting in arenas??) --Summary-- Overall a very fun game, It feels much less random then Mario Kart Wii, and it's a lot of fun, whether your a Mario kart fan! or have not played since mk64 or DD, You'll enjoy this game none-the-less.

Despite the fact that I have far, far fewer friends in my life that are willing to play Mario Kart with me now than I did with the N64 game, I actually think this is a better Mario Kart than any that have come before. It outranks my hyperbolic memories of yesteryear. I just wish I had more people to play it with. If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1. One of the reviews said that you can't go shopping and turtle shells represent animal abuse...But anyway, this is definitely the best mario kart game to date. First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

Onwards to Smash Bros and Zelda!!"]}, {"Username":["Nutwiisystem.Com"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["It's no secret that the Wii U has been struggling. Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}]
[{"Username":["CynicalKiwi"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["From what I've experienced so far, this is definitely one of my favorite Mario Kart games. I daresay it bypasses even Mario Kart Wii--my previous favorite. The graphics, soundtrack, and track design are all amazing. The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc). My one complaint is Battle Mode. Rather than, like the previous entries, giving you tracks made specifically for Battle Mode, in MK8 you have to battle on the same tracks that you race on, which isn't nearly as fun in my opinion."]}, {"Username":["Dov"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["My favorite MK in the series has always been Mario Kart 64. The 3DS and DS versions round out the top 3 MK. I bought it to play with my 5 year old but unfortunately he doesn't really care for this. Yet. Oh well, because I played it last night after I put him to bed and this game is awesome. Things I like: 1. The 150CC levels are more challenging than ever. You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in. I've been playing Nintendo since the very beginning with Kung Fu and Balloon Fight the NES. Wii U is a great system and this is the best game that I've played on it to date.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died. I read really long fantasy books in my bedroom late at night so I would feel powerful. In high school I found I had a gift for all things involving the track. Except girls. They thought I was a jerk. Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart. This game will turn your life around...and upside down. Online is good also. Just buy it...but do it before the free game deal is up from Nintendo. Pikmin 3 was my choice. It is also life altering."]}, {"Username":["John Kless"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I had the choice between PS4 Watchdogs and Mario Kart 8, I chose Mario Kart. Best choice ever. Since getting it, my other systems haven't been turned on and it hasn't been removed from my Wii U. If Nintendo had this as a launch game they would have ruled this generation. The most impressive thing about the graphics are the reflection effects, especially in puddles on the tracks. The rest of the reviewers have hit on other high points."]}, {"Username":["Alex K"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["FIrst of all the core of what this game is is done very well. Controls are tight, graphics are outstanding, character selection is wonderful and kart customization is better than ever. I have a few issues however - - My biggest issue is online chat. You CANNOT chat in game with your mic and headset, not even with friends. You can only chat with friends in lobbies before the race starts. You can't chat with unconfirmed friends at all. This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people. This essentially means there is no battle mode in Mario Kart 8. Because of these 2 flaws I can only give 4 stars but what really matters AKA the core racing mode gamplay is flawless and this is a must buy for any Wii U owner."]}, {"Username":["Ryan"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I purchased a wii u specifically to play mario kart 8 and I have not been disappointed.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games.

If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1. One of the reviews said that you can't go shopping and turtle shells represent animal abuse...But anyway, this is definitely the best mario kart game to date. First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

Unfortunately, Mario Kart 8's Battle Mode is a huge problem using normal race tracks. It is to hard to find someone and when you do, they might as well kill you with a green shell.

Onwards to Smash Bros and Zelda!!"]}, {"Username":["Nutwiisystem.Com"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["It's no secret that the Wii U has been struggling. Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days.

After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE!

The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race! It is very fun and I didn\u2019t have any bad experiences with people dropping out or doing other stupid things, which is what I have been pretty accustom to with other online gaming experiences I have tried.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen.

Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry.

This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game. It is really cool to be able to race NPC's than compare your skills to real people."]}, {"Username":["K.

This game is awesome and epic all at the same time. The one thing I always like to point out that when Nintendo makes a game, they put their heart and soul into it. The graphics and music is amazing. The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games. In fact, I like how the customization of your kart and the track differences effect the outcome. Time flies when playing this game.

The graphics for this game are very well polished and the colors definitely grab your attention. This game feels almost exactly like Mario Kart 7, but it has it's perks compared to the 3DS Mario Kart. One being that there are bikes in this game, but better than the Wii Version because both types of vehicles are decently comparable in performance. In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels. I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors.

Despite the fact that I have far, far fewer friends in my life that are willing to play Mario Kart with me now than I did with the N64 game, I actually think this is a better Mario Kart than any that have come before. It outranks my hyperbolic memories of yesteryear. I just wish I had more people to play it with. If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game.

First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days. Follow that with the N64 version, which in my opinion, was one of the hugest leaps forward in arcade / party racing for its time. After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right. I wasn\u2019t able to change the button configuration\u2026 I would have been curious to see how it felt using a \u2018trigger\u2019 button as the gas instead of the \u2018A\u2019 button \u2013 but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race! It is very fun and I didn\u2019t have any bad experiences with people dropping out or doing other stupid things, which is what I have been pretty accustom to with other online gaming experiences I have tried. I didn\u2019t really notice any lagging issues, and I was using wireless internet. Very impressed! Let me finish by saying that I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Wii and was on the fence with the Wii U. This is one of the titles that swayed my decision to buy it - and I have no regrets!"]}, {"Username":["Hawke525"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Beautiful graphics, gameplay is awesome, much more balanced. Music is also huge plus. Another praise I'll give is the online experience. Connecting is much quicker and during races, it was smooth. It does feel different so you'll have to get use to it for a bit. But once you do. You'll want to play this over MK Wii. Another complaint is that there's too many baby characters and koopas imo. Or at least add more characters that aren't either the two groups. But overall it's the go-to Mario Kart game for the modern age. Solid 9/10. Recommend it if you LOVE the Mario Kart series."]}]
[{"Username":["CynicalKiwi"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["From what I've experienced so far, this is definitely one of my favorite Mario Kart games. I daresay it bypasses even Mario Kart Wii--my previous favorite. The graphics, soundtrack, and track design are all amazing. The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc). My one complaint is Battle Mode. Rather than, like the previous entries, giving you tracks made specifically for Battle Mode, in MK8 you have to battle on the same tracks that you race on, which isn't nearly as fun in my opinion."]}, {"Username":["Dov"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["My favorite MK in the series has always been Mario Kart 64. The 3DS and DS versions round out the top 3 MK. I bought it to play with my 5 year old but unfortunately he doesn't really care for this. Yet. Oh well, because I played it last night after I put him to bed and this game is awesome. Things I like: 1. The 150CC levels are more challenging than ever. You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died. I read really long fantasy books in my bedroom late at night so I would feel powerful. In high school I found I had a gift for all things involving the track. Except girls. They thought I was a jerk. Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart.

Controls are tight, graphics are outstanding, character selection is wonderful and kart customization is better than ever. I have a few issues however - - My biggest issue is online chat. You CANNOT chat in game with your mic and headset, not even with friends. You can only chat with friends in lobbies before the race starts. You can't chat with unconfirmed friends at all. This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people. This essentially means there is no battle mode in Mario Kart 8.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1. One of the reviews said that you can't go shopping and turtle shells represent animal abuse...But anyway, this is definitely the best mario kart game to date. First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

Unfortunately, Mario Kart 8's Battle Mode is a huge problem using normal race tracks. It is to hard to find someone and when you do, they might as well kill you with a green shell.

Onwards to Smash Bros and Zelda!!"]}, {"Username":["Nutwiisystem.Com"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["It's no secret that the Wii U has been struggling. Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days.

After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right.

The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming.

I read really long fantasy books in my bedroom late at night so I would feel powerful. In high school I found I had a gift for all things involving the track. Except girls. They thought I was a jerk. Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart. This game will turn your life around...and upside down. Online is good also. Just buy it...but do it before the free game deal is up from Nintendo. Pikmin 3 was my choice. It is also life altering."]}, {"Username":["John Kless"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I had the choice between PS4 Watchdogs and Mario Kart 8, I chose Mario Kart. Best choice ever.

The most impressive thing about the graphics are the reflection effects, especially in puddles on the tracks.

Controls are tight, graphics are outstanding, character selection is wonderful and kart customization is better than ever. I have a few issues however - - My biggest issue is online chat. You CANNOT chat in game with your mic and headset, not even with friends. You can only chat with friends in lobbies before the race starts. You can't chat with unconfirmed friends at all. This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people. This essentially means there is no battle mode in Mario Kart 8. Because of these 2 flaws I can only give 4 stars but what really matters AKA the core racing mode gamplay is flawless and this is a must buy for any Wii U owner."]}, {"Username":["Ryan"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I purchased a wii u specifically to play mario kart 8 and I have not been disappointed.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games.

If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV.

Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!)

The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!).

You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad.

So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1. One of the reviews said that you can't go shopping and turtle shells represent animal abuse...But anyway, this is definitely the best mario kart game to date. First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before. Regardless I can't find a single wrong thing with mario kart 8, Nintendo set out to make a show stopper to show everyone the wii u's powers, and this is just a start.

With its 30 characters, wonderful graphics, level design, and racing fun, you can't go wrong. Mario Kart 8 has all the modes that Mario Kart 7 had. Unfortunately, Mario Kart 8's Battle Mode is a huge problem using normal race tracks. It is to hard to find someone and when you do, they might as well kill you with a green shell. The new items work great. In conclusion, Mario Kart 8 is an amazing game, and I recommend it to any Wii U owner.

Onwards to Smash Bros and Zelda!!"]}, {"Username":["Nutwiisystem.Com"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["It's no secret that the Wii U has been struggling. Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days. Follow that with the N64 version, which in my opinion, was one of the hugest leaps forward in arcade / party racing for its time. After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right. I wasn\u2019t able to change the button configuration\u2026 I would have been curious to see how it felt using a \u2018trigger\u2019 button as the gas instead of the \u2018A\u2019 button \u2013 but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race! It is very fun and I didn\u2019t have any bad experiences with people dropping out or doing other stupid things, which is what I have been pretty accustom to with other online gaming experiences I have tried. I didn\u2019t really notice any lagging issues, and I was using wireless internet. Very impressed! Let me finish by saying that I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Wii and was on the fence with the Wii U.

You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in.

This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people.

Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry.

This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game. It is really cool to be able to race NPC's than compare your skills to real people."]}, {"Username":["K.

This game is awesome and epic all at the same time. The one thing I always like to point out that when Nintendo makes a game, they put their heart and soul into it. The graphics and music is amazing. The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games. In fact, I like how the customization of your kart and the track differences effect the outcome. Time flies when playing this game. Thank you Nintendo for making a great game!"]}, {"Username":["Miles B."],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Mario Kart 8 is a great addition to the WiiU. The graphics for this game are very well polished and the colors definitely grab your attention. This game feels almost exactly like Mario Kart 7, but it has it's perks compared to the 3DS Mario Kart. One being that there are bikes in this game, but better than the Wii Version because both types of vehicles are decently comparable in performance. In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels. I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors. All-in-all, I give Mario Kart 8 a resounding five stars, and I would most definitely recommend this to anyone that may or may not have a WiiU yet."]}, {"Username":["Cory"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["MK8 is absolutely phenomenal and Wii U is the best gaming system out there. MK8 has 32 brilliant tracks that are so rich that they're hard to master completely.

And 150CC mode is hard enough that it will have you playing over and over trying to earn all of the gold trophies. Plus, every Grand Prix you finish opens up new characters and vehicle mods. Lastly, Online play is fantastic and loads of fun. This game is the most beautiful game I've played, so ridiculously fun, and addicting.

Despite the fact that I have far, far fewer friends in my life that are willing to play Mario Kart with me now than I did with the N64 game, I actually think this is a better Mario Kart than any that have come before. It outranks my hyperbolic memories of yesteryear. I just wish I had more people to play it with. If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1.

First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days. Follow that with the N64 version, which in my opinion, was one of the hugest leaps forward in arcade / party racing for its time. After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right. I wasn\u2019t able to change the button configuration\u2026 I would have been curious to see how it felt using a \u2018trigger\u2019 button as the gas instead of the \u2018A\u2019 button \u2013 but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race! It is very fun and I didn\u2019t have any bad experiences with people dropping out or doing other stupid things, which is what I have been pretty accustom to with other online gaming experiences I have tried. I didn\u2019t really notice any lagging issues, and I was using wireless internet. Very impressed! Let me finish by saying that I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Wii and was on the fence with the Wii U.

I daresay it bypasses even Mario Kart Wii--my previous favorite. The graphics, soundtrack, and track design are all amazing. The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc). My one complaint is Battle Mode. Rather than, like the previous entries, giving you tracks made specifically for Battle Mode, in MK8 you have to battle on the same tracks that you race on, which isn't nearly as fun in my opinion."]}, {"Username":["Dov"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["My favorite MK in the series has always been Mario Kart 64. The 3DS and DS versions round out the top 3 MK. I bought it to play with my 5 year old but unfortunately he doesn't really care for this. Yet. Oh well, because I played it last night after I put him to bed and this game is awesome. Things I like: 1. The 150CC levels are more challenging than ever. You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died. I read really long fantasy books in my bedroom late at night so I would feel powerful. In high school I found I had a gift for all things involving the track. Except girls. They thought I was a jerk. Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart.

You CANNOT chat in game with your mic and headset, not even with friends. You can only chat with friends in lobbies before the race starts. You can't chat with unconfirmed friends at all. This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1. One of the reviews said that you can't go shopping and turtle shells represent animal abuse...But anyway, this is definitely the best mario kart game to date. First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

With its 30 characters, wonderful graphics, level design, and racing fun, you can't go wrong. Mario Kart 8 has all the modes that Mario Kart 7 had. Unfortunately, Mario Kart 8's Battle Mode is a huge problem using normal race tracks. It is to hard to find someone and when you do, they might as well kill you with a green shell.

Onwards to Smash Bros and Zelda!!"]}, {"Username":["Nutwiisystem.Com"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["It's no secret that the Wii U has been struggling. Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days.

After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE!

The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!!

The transitions into flying, underwater, standard driving, and hovering are seamless, and flow perfectly! The level design is ingenious and is an absolute thrill! On most of the new courses there are many different paths, short cuts allowing for continuous exploration and variability. The retro courses too have been reworked a bit, keeping the same feel and theme but restructured a bit to maximize the use of the many abilities that the Mario Kart 8 Karts and bikes have, and instead of compromising the integrity of the classics, it simply redefines them while remaining true to the heritage.

The 3DS and DS versions round out the top 3 MK. I bought it to play with my 5 year old but unfortunately he doesn't really care for this. Yet. Oh well, because I played it last night after I put him to bed and this game is awesome. Things I like: 1. The 150CC levels are more challenging than ever. You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died. I read really long fantasy books in my bedroom late at night so I would feel powerful. In high school I found I had a gift for all things involving the track. Except girls. They thought I was a jerk. Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart. This game will turn your life around...and upside down. Online is good also. Just buy it...but do it before the free game deal is up from Nintendo. Pikmin 3 was my choice. It is also life altering."]}, {"Username":["John Kless"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I had the choice between PS4 Watchdogs and Mario Kart 8, I chose Mario Kart. Best choice ever. Since getting it, my other systems haven't been turned on and it hasn't been removed from my Wii U. If Nintendo had this as a launch game they would have ruled this generation. The most impressive thing about the graphics are the reflection effects, especially in puddles on the tracks. The rest of the reviewers have hit on other high points."]}, {"Username":["Alex K"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["FIrst of all the core of what this game is is done very well. Controls are tight, graphics are outstanding, character selection is wonderful and kart customization is better than ever. I have a few issues however - - My biggest issue is online chat. You CANNOT chat in game with your mic and headset, not even with friends. You can only chat with friends in lobbies before the race starts. You can't chat with unconfirmed friends at all. This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people. This essentially means there is no battle mode in Mario Kart 8. Because of these 2 flaws I can only give 4 stars but what really matters AKA the core racing mode gamplay is flawless and this is a must buy for any Wii U owner."]}, {"Username":["Ryan"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I purchased a wii u specifically to play mario kart 8 and I have not been disappointed.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games.

In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels.

Despite the fact that I have far, far fewer friends in my life that are willing to play Mario Kart with me now than I did with the N64 game, I actually think this is a better Mario Kart than any that have come before.

If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV.

I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1. One of the reviews said that you can't go shopping and turtle shells represent animal abuse...But anyway, this is definitely the best mario kart game to date. First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before. Regardless I can't find a single wrong thing with mario kart 8, Nintendo set out to make a show stopper to show everyone the wii u's powers, and this is just a start.

With its 30 characters, wonderful graphics, level design, and racing fun, you can't go wrong. Mario Kart 8 has all the modes that Mario Kart 7 had. Unfortunately, Mario Kart 8's Battle Mode is a huge problem using normal race tracks. It is to hard to find someone and when you do, they might as well kill you with a green shell.

Onwards to Smash Bros and Zelda!!"]}, {"Username":["Nutwiisystem.Com"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["It's no secret that the Wii U has been struggling. Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days.

After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right. I wasn\u2019t able to change the button configuration\u2026 I would have been curious to see how it felt using a \u2018trigger\u2019 button as the gas instead of the \u2018A\u2019 button \u2013 but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race! It is very fun and I didn\u2019t have any bad experiences with people dropping out or doing other stupid things, which is what I have been pretty accustom to with other online gaming experiences I have tried.

The transitions into flying, underwater, standard driving, and hovering are seamless, and flow perfectly! The level design is ingenious and is an absolute thrill! On most of the new courses there are many different paths, short cuts allowing for continuous exploration and variability. The retro courses too have been reworked a bit, keeping the same feel and theme but restructured a bit to maximize the use of the many abilities that the Mario Kart 8 Karts and bikes have, and instead of compromising the integrity of the classics, it simply redefines them while remaining true to the heritage.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little.

I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people.

Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry.

This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game. It is really cool to be able to race NPC's than compare your skills to real people."]}, {"Username":["K.

This game is awesome and epic all at the same time. The one thing I always like to point out that when Nintendo makes a game, they put their heart and soul into it. The graphics and music is amazing. The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games. In fact, I like how the customization of your kart and the track differences effect the outcome. Time flies when playing this game.

The graphics for this game are very well polished and the colors definitely grab your attention. This game feels almost exactly like Mario Kart 7, but it has it's perks compared to the 3DS Mario Kart. One being that there are bikes in this game, but better than the Wii Version because both types of vehicles are decently comparable in performance. In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels. I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors.

Despite the fact that I have far, far fewer friends in my life that are willing to play Mario Kart with me now than I did with the N64 game, I actually think this is a better Mario Kart than any that have come before. It outranks my hyperbolic memories of yesteryear. I just wish I had more people to play it with. If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1. One of the reviews said that you can't go shopping and turtle shells represent animal abuse...But anyway, this is definitely the best mario kart game to date. First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

Onwards to Smash Bros and Zelda!!"]}, {"Username":["Nutwiisystem.Com"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["It's no secret that the Wii U has been struggling. Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days. Follow that with the N64 version, which in my opinion, was one of the hugest leaps forward in arcade / party racing for its time. After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right. I wasn\u2019t able to change the button configuration\u2026 I would have been curious to see how it felt using a \u2018trigger\u2019 button as the gas instead of the \u2018A\u2019 button \u2013 but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race! It is very fun and I didn\u2019t have any bad experiences with people dropping out or doing other stupid things, which is what I have been pretty accustom to with other online gaming experiences I have tried. I didn\u2019t really notice any lagging issues, and I was using wireless internet. Very impressed! Let me finish by saying that I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Wii and was on the fence with the Wii U.

The transitions into flying, underwater, standard driving, and hovering are seamless, and flow perfectly! The level design is ingenious and is an absolute thrill! On most of the new courses there are many different paths, short cuts allowing for continuous exploration and variability. The retro courses too have been reworked a bit, keeping the same feel and theme but restructured a bit to maximize the use of the many abilities that the Mario Kart 8 Karts and bikes have, and instead of compromising the integrity of the classics, it simply redefines them while remaining true to the heritage. Also, on a side not, the instant replay is awesome! It is hilarious to slow the camera just as you get smacked with a turtle shell and watch the character's expressions! Overall great game!

Mario Kart has always delivered to this end. But the latest installment is especially satisfying for a few reasons: ? Graphics. Finally, a truly pretty Mario Kart game. The series gets a much needed graphical upgrade courtesy of the Wii U. ? Characters. 30 of them. Enough said. ? Unlockables. You have to unlock 14 of the 30 characters. You have to unlock most of the tracks. You get to unlock karts... and tires... and parasails. It really gives you more reason to play and a greater sense of accomplishment. A couple of minor negatives: ? No coin runners. They kept balloon battle, which isn't as fun as coin runners in my opinion. Oh well, guess it's all about the racing! ? If you are used to playing Mario Kart with little kids, you have grown fond of the 12th place rule where the race will automatically end after 11th place finishes. Well, for some reason, Nintendo has decided to make you suffer. Mario Kart 8 forces you to sit there and watch the young one struggle their way to the finish line. Oh well, bathroom break!"]}]
[{"Username":["CynicalKiwi"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["From what I've experienced so far, this is definitely one of my favorite Mario Kart games. I daresay it bypasses even Mario Kart Wii--my previous favorite. The graphics, soundtrack, and track design are all amazing. The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc). My one complaint is Battle Mode. Rather than, like the previous entries, giving you tracks made specifically for Battle Mode, in MK8 you have to battle on the same tracks that you race on, which isn't nearly as fun in my opinion."]}, {"Username":["Dov"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["My favorite MK in the series has always been Mario Kart 64. The 3DS and DS versions round out the top 3 MK. I bought it to play with my 5 year old but unfortunately he doesn't really care for this. Yet. Oh well, because I played it last night after I put him to bed and this game is awesome. Things I like: 1. The 150CC levels are more challenging than ever. You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in. I've been playing Nintendo since the very beginning with Kung Fu and Balloon Fight the NES. Wii U is a great system and this is the best game that I've played on it to date.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died. I read really long fantasy books in my bedroom late at night so I would feel powerful. In high school I found I had a gift for all things involving the track. Except girls. They thought I was a jerk. Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart.

Controls are tight, graphics are outstanding, character selection is wonderful and kart customization is better than ever. I have a few issues however - - My biggest issue is online chat. You CANNOT chat in game with your mic and headset, not even with friends. You can only chat with friends in lobbies before the race starts. You can't chat with unconfirmed friends at all. This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people. This essentially means there is no battle mode in Mario Kart 8.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry.

This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

(just like the other games, it dose not tell you how to unlock character or parts, or even how close you are to an unlock) -The roster... (they filled it up with koopalings, and a metal peach, there are so many other thing they could have added) -Battle mode (what happened to fighting in arenas??) --Summary-- Overall a very fun game, It feels much less random then Mario Kart Wii, and it's a lot of fun, whether your a Mario kart fan! or have not played since mk64 or DD, You'll enjoy this game none-the-less. Note: I did NOT take off a star for the 720p issue, that's not a problem. it's a choice they made, and the game still looks great!"]}, {"Username":["Daffne Vigot Peralta"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Simply put; the best MK entry so far.

Despite the fact that I have far, far fewer friends in my life that are willing to play Mario Kart with me now than I did with the N64 game, I actually think this is a better Mario Kart than any that have come before. It outranks my hyperbolic memories of yesteryear. I just wish I had more people to play it with. If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1. One of the reviews said that you can't go shopping and turtle shells represent animal abuse...But anyway, this is definitely the best mario kart game to date. First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

Onwards to Smash Bros and Zelda!!"]}, {"Username":["Nutwiisystem.Com"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["It's no secret that the Wii U has been struggling. Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days.

After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight.

I wasn\u2019t able to change the button configuration\u2026 I would have been curious to see how it felt using a \u2018trigger\u2019 button as the gas instead of the \u2018A\u2019 button \u2013 but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race! It is very fun and I didn\u2019t have any bad experiences with people dropping out or doing other stupid things, which is what I have been pretty accustom to with other online gaming experiences I have tried. I didn\u2019t really notice any lagging issues, and I was using wireless internet. Very impressed! Let me finish by saying that I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Wii and was on the fence with the Wii U.

Music is also huge plus. Another praise I'll give is the online experience. Connecting is much quicker and during races, it was smooth. It does feel different so you'll have to get use to it for a bit. But once you do. You'll want to play this over MK Wii. Another complaint is that there's too many baby characters and koopas imo. Or at least add more characters that aren't either the two groups. But overall it's the go-to Mario Kart game for the modern age. Solid 9/10.

I was concerned about the defying gravity, if that was going to take the game to far into ridiculous to be taken seriously, but I am thoroughly impressed by the game. The transitions into flying, underwater, standard driving, and hovering are seamless, and flow perfectly! The level design is ingenious and is an absolute thrill! On most of the new courses there are many different paths, short cuts allowing for continuous exploration and variability. The retro courses too have been reworked a bit, keeping the same feel and theme but restructured a bit to maximize the use of the many abilities that the Mario Kart 8 Karts and bikes have, and instead of compromising the integrity of the classics, it simply redefines them while remaining true to the heritage. Also, on a side not, the instant replay is awesome! It is hilarious to slow the camera just as you get smacked with a turtle shell and watch the character's expressions! Overall great game!

You have to unlock most of the tracks. You get to unlock karts... and tires... and parasails. It really gives you more reason to play and a greater sense of accomplishment.

It arrived and suddenly I'm the best mom and wife in the history of ever! After playing it myself, I'm kind of partial to me, too. ;) We've purchased many \"Mario Kart\" games over the years and I was wondering if this one wouldn't just be a newer version, slightly different, but pretty much the same as the others. I was happily wrong. The principle is the same, but there are so many new features and options... and the courses are so fun!! My 8 yr old loves that you can customize your kart. If you enjoy previous versions of Mario Kart or if you're new to this type of game, I'd sure recommend getting it. You won't be disappointed. Also, because it's hard to find games that kiddos can play, I'll let you know that my barely 5 year old daughter can play this along with the family. Granted, she's not going to come in first place, but she's not in last either. (Though my 8yr old sweetly holds off the computer-players so her sister can win every now and then.)

[{"Username":["CynicalKiwi"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["From what I've experienced so far, this is definitely one of my favorite Mario Kart games. I daresay it bypasses even Mario Kart Wii--my previous favorite. The graphics, soundtrack, and track design are all amazing. The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc). My one complaint is Battle Mode. Rather than, like the previous entries, giving you tracks made specifically for Battle Mode, in MK8 you have to battle on the same tracks that you race on, which isn't nearly as fun in my opinion."]}, {"Username":["Dov"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["My favorite MK in the series has always been Mario Kart 64. The 3DS and DS versions round out the top 3 MK. I bought it to play with my 5 year old but unfortunately he doesn't really care for this. Yet. Oh well, because I played it last night after I put him to bed and this game is awesome. Things I like: 1. The 150CC levels are more challenging than ever. You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died. I read really long fantasy books in my bedroom late at night so I would feel powerful. In high school I found I had a gift for all things involving the track. Except girls. They thought I was a jerk. Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart.

You CANNOT chat in game with your mic and headset, not even with friends. You can only chat with friends in lobbies before the race starts. You can't chat with unconfirmed friends at all. This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people. This essentially means there is no battle mode in Mario Kart 8.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1. One of the reviews said that you can't go shopping and turtle shells represent animal abuse...But anyway, this is definitely the best mario kart game to date. First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

With its 30 characters, wonderful graphics, level design, and racing fun, you can't go wrong. Mario Kart 8 has all the modes that Mario Kart 7 had. Unfortunately, Mario Kart 8's Battle Mode is a huge problem using normal race tracks. It is to hard to find someone and when you do, they might as well kill you with a green shell.

Onwards to Smash Bros and Zelda!!"]}, {"Username":["Nutwiisystem.Com"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["It's no secret that the Wii U has been struggling. Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days.

After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right.

The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!!

The retro courses too have been reworked a bit, keeping the same feel and theme but restructured a bit to maximize the use of the many abilities that the Mario Kart 8 Karts and bikes have, and instead of compromising the integrity of the classics, it simply redefines them while remaining true to the heritage.

I was happily wrong. The principle is the same, but there are so many new features and options... and the courses are so fun!! My 8 yr old loves that you can customize your kart. If you enjoy previous versions of Mario Kart or if you're new to this type of game, I'd sure recommend getting it. You won't be disappointed. Also, because it's hard to find games that kiddos can play, I'll let you know that my barely 5 year old daughter can play this along with the family. Granted, she's not going to come in first place, but she's not in last either. (Though my 8yr old sweetly holds off the computer-players so her sister can win every now and then.) This is definitely one that your little kiddo can play."]}, {"Username":["Big Mac 75"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This is just pure fun! It is a true racing game. It is less about items as it is about precision driving. The graphics are stunning. The driving mechanics are perfect. The new tracks are great. The remakes of old tracks are stunning. Just an absolute blast. If I didn't have a Wii U, this would 100% make getting one worth it. *Only Caveat - Hopefully Battle Mode gets updated. It is not up to par with the rest of the game."]}]
[{"Username":["CynicalKiwi"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["From what I've experienced so far, this is definitely one of my favorite Mario Kart games. I daresay it bypasses even Mario Kart Wii--my previous favorite. The graphics, soundtrack, and track design are all amazing. The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc). My one complaint is Battle Mode. Rather than, like the previous entries, giving you tracks made specifically for Battle Mode, in MK8 you have to battle on the same tracks that you race on, which isn't nearly as fun in my opinion."]}, {"Username":["Dov"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["My favorite MK in the series has always been Mario Kart 64. The 3DS and DS versions round out the top 3 MK. I bought it to play with my 5 year old but unfortunately he doesn't really care for this. Yet. Oh well, because I played it last night after I put him to bed and this game is awesome. Things I like: 1. The 150CC levels are more challenging than ever. You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in. I've been playing Nintendo since the very beginning with Kung Fu and Balloon Fight the NES. Wii U is a great system and this is the best game that I've played on it to date.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died. I read really long fantasy books in my bedroom late at night so I would feel powerful. In high school I found I had a gift for all things involving the track. Except girls. They thought I was a jerk. Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart. This game will turn your life around...and upside down. Online is good also. Just buy it...but do it before the free game deal is up from Nintendo. Pikmin 3 was my choice. It is also life altering."]}, {"Username":["John Kless"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I had the choice between PS4 Watchdogs and Mario Kart 8, I chose Mario Kart. Best choice ever.

The most impressive thing about the graphics are the reflection effects, especially in puddles on the tracks. The rest of the reviewers have hit on other high points."]}, {"Username":["Alex K"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["FIrst of all the core of what this game is is done very well. Controls are tight, graphics are outstanding, character selection is wonderful and kart customization is better than ever. I have a few issues however - - My biggest issue is online chat. You CANNOT chat in game with your mic and headset, not even with friends. You can only chat with friends in lobbies before the race starts. You can't chat with unconfirmed friends at all. This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people. This essentially means there is no battle mode in Mario Kart 8.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games.

If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1. One of the reviews said that you can't go shopping and turtle shells represent animal abuse...But anyway, this is definitely the best mario kart game to date. First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

Unfortunately, Mario Kart 8's Battle Mode is a huge problem using normal race tracks. It is to hard to find someone and when you do, they might as well kill you with a green shell.

Onwards to Smash Bros and Zelda!!"]}, {"Username":["Nutwiisystem.Com"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["It's no secret that the Wii U has been struggling. Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days.

After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right. I wasn\u2019t able to change the button configuration\u2026 I would have been curious to see how it felt using a \u2018trigger\u2019 button as the gas instead of the \u2018A\u2019 button \u2013 but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race!

On most of the new courses there are many different paths, short cuts allowing for continuous exploration and variability. The retro courses too have been reworked a bit, keeping the same feel and theme but restructured a bit to maximize the use of the many abilities that the Mario Kart 8 Karts and bikes have, and instead of compromising the integrity of the classics, it simply redefines them while remaining true to the heritage.

This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people. This essentially means there is no battle mode in Mario Kart 8. Because of these 2 flaws I can only give 4 stars but what really matters AKA the core racing mode gamplay is flawless and this is a must buy for any Wii U owner."]}, {"Username":["Ryan"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I purchased a wii u specifically to play mario kart 8 and I have not been disappointed.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games.

The graphics for this game are very well polished and the colors definitely grab your attention.

Despite the fact that I have far, far fewer friends in my life that are willing to play Mario Kart with me now than I did with the N64 game, I actually think this is a better Mario Kart than any that have come before. It outranks my hyperbolic memories of yesteryear. I just wish I had more people to play it with. If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1. One of the reviews said that you can't go shopping and turtle shells represent animal abuse...But anyway, this is definitely the best mario kart game to date. First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before. Regardless I can't find a single wrong thing with mario kart 8, Nintendo set out to make a show stopper to show everyone the wii u's powers, and this is just a start.

With its 30 characters, wonderful graphics, level design, and racing fun, you can't go wrong. Mario Kart 8 has all the modes that Mario Kart 7 had. Unfortunately, Mario Kart 8's Battle Mode is a huge problem using normal race tracks. It is to hard to find someone and when you do, they might as well kill you with a green shell. The new items work great. In conclusion, Mario Kart 8 is an amazing game, and I recommend it to any Wii U owner.

Onwards to Smash Bros and Zelda!!"]}, {"Username":["Nutwiisystem.Com"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["It's no secret that the Wii U has been struggling. Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days. Follow that with the N64 version, which in my opinion, was one of the hugest leaps forward in arcade / party racing for its time. After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right. I wasn\u2019t able to change the button configuration\u2026 I would have been curious to see how it felt using a \u2018trigger\u2019 button as the gas instead of the \u2018A\u2019 button \u2013 but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race! It is very fun and I didn\u2019t have any bad experiences with people dropping out or doing other stupid things, which is what I have been pretty accustom to with other online gaming experiences I have tried. I didn\u2019t really notice any lagging issues, and I was using wireless internet. Very impressed! Let me finish by saying that I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Wii and was on the fence with the Wii U.

The transitions into flying, underwater, standard driving, and hovering are seamless, and flow perfectly! The level design is ingenious and is an absolute thrill! On most of the new courses there are many different paths, short cuts allowing for continuous exploration and variability. The retro courses too have been reworked a bit, keeping the same feel and theme but restructured a bit to maximize the use of the many abilities that the Mario Kart 8 Karts and bikes have, and instead of compromising the integrity of the classics, it simply redefines them while remaining true to the heritage.

Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs.

I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech.

Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game. It is really cool to be able to race NPC's than compare your skills to real people."]}, {"Username":["K.

This game is awesome and epic all at the same time. The one thing I always like to point out that when Nintendo makes a game, they put their heart and soul into it. The graphics and music is amazing. The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games. In fact, I like how the customization of your kart and the track differences effect the outcome. Time flies when playing this game.

The graphics for this game are very well polished and the colors definitely grab your attention. This game feels almost exactly like Mario Kart 7, but it has it's perks compared to the 3DS Mario Kart. One being that there are bikes in this game, but better than the Wii Version because both types of vehicles are decently comparable in performance. In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels. I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors.

And 150CC mode is hard enough that it will have you playing over and over trying to earn all of the gold trophies. Plus, every Grand Prix you finish opens up new characters and vehicle mods.

It outranks my hyperbolic memories of yesteryear. I just wish I had more people to play it with. If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1. One of the reviews said that you can't go shopping and turtle shells represent animal abuse...But anyway, this is definitely the best mario kart game to date. First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before. Regardless I can't find a single wrong thing with mario kart 8, Nintendo set out to make a show stopper to show everyone the wii u's powers, and this is just a start.

With its 30 characters, wonderful graphics, level design, and racing fun, you can't go wrong. Mario Kart 8 has all the modes that Mario Kart 7 had. Unfortunately, Mario Kart 8's Battle Mode is a huge problem using normal race tracks. It is to hard to find someone and when you do, they might as well kill you with a green shell. The new items work great. In conclusion, Mario Kart 8 is an amazing game, and I recommend it to any Wii U owner.

Onwards to Smash Bros and Zelda!!"]}, {"Username":["Nutwiisystem.Com"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["It's no secret that the Wii U has been struggling. Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days. Follow that with the N64 version, which in my opinion, was one of the hugest leaps forward in arcade / party racing for its time. After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right. I wasn\u2019t able to change the button configuration\u2026 I would have been curious to see how it felt using a \u2018trigger\u2019 button as the gas instead of the \u2018A\u2019 button \u2013 but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race! It is very fun and I didn\u2019t have any bad experiences with people dropping out or doing other stupid things, which is what I have been pretty accustom to with other online gaming experiences I have tried. I didn\u2019t really notice any lagging issues, and I was using wireless internet. Very impressed! Let me finish by saying that I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Wii and was on the fence with the Wii U.

The transitions into flying, underwater, standard driving, and hovering are seamless, and flow perfectly! The level design is ingenious and is an absolute thrill! On most of the new courses there are many different paths, short cuts allowing for continuous exploration and variability. The retro courses too have been reworked a bit, keeping the same feel and theme but restructured a bit to maximize the use of the many abilities that the Mario Kart 8 Karts and bikes have, and instead of compromising the integrity of the classics, it simply redefines them while remaining true to the heritage. Also, on a side not, the instant replay is awesome! It is hilarious to slow the camera just as you get smacked with a turtle shell and watch the character's expressions! Overall great game!

It's a lot of fun and the online racing helps build some competitive nature in my son. Whenever I'm unable to play the game with him, and he's tired of beating up on the computers, it helps that he can go online to play against other people. He can vote for what map he wants to play, and its randomly selected so there's no Tyranny of the Majority going on (where a single map may get chosen indefinitely). There are a lot of variations of karts, gliders, wheels to unlock, as well as characters.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people.

Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game. It is really cool to be able to race NPC's than compare your skills to real people."]}, {"Username":["K. Lovick \"Keen Queen\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["My kids and I have been anxiously waiting this game for months. Yes, it is worth the wait. This game is awesome and epic all at the same time. The one thing I always like to point out that when Nintendo makes a game, they put their heart and soul into it. The graphics and music is amazing. The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games. In fact, I like how the customization of your kart and the track differences effect the outcome. Time flies when playing this game. Thank you Nintendo for making a great game!"]}, {"Username":["Miles B."],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Mario Kart 8 is a great addition to the WiiU. The graphics for this game are very well polished and the colors definitely grab your attention. This game feels almost exactly like Mario Kart 7, but it has it's perks compared to the 3DS Mario Kart. One being that there are bikes in this game, but better than the Wii Version because both types of vehicles are decently comparable in performance. In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels. I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors. All-in-all, I give Mario Kart 8 a resounding five stars, and I would most definitely recommend this to anyone that may or may not have a WiiU yet."]}, {"Username":["Cory"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["MK8 is absolutely phenomenal and Wii U is the best gaming system out there. MK8 has 32 brilliant tracks that are so rich that they're hard to master completely. Each level has so many different variables, short cuts, and strategies by the computer that you will never get bored. And 150CC mode is hard enough that it will have you playing over and over trying to earn all of the gold trophies. Plus, every Grand Prix you finish opens up new characters and vehicle mods. Lastly, Online play is fantastic and loads of fun. This game is the most beautiful game I've played, so ridiculously fun, and addicting.

I just played 12 races, and there was a MAXIMUM of one blue shell per race, And that a huge Deal for 150cc.

Despite the fact that I have far, far fewer friends in my life that are willing to play Mario Kart with me now than I did with the N64 game, I actually think this is a better Mario Kart than any that have come before. It outranks my hyperbolic memories of yesteryear. I just wish I had more people to play it with. If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1. One of the reviews said that you can't go shopping and turtle shells represent animal abuse...But anyway, this is definitely the best mario kart game to date. First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days. Follow that with the N64 version, which in my opinion, was one of the hugest leaps forward in arcade / party racing for its time. After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right. I wasn\u2019t able to change the button configuration\u2026 I would have been curious to see how it felt using a \u2018trigger\u2019 button as the gas instead of the \u2018A\u2019 button \u2013 but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race! It is very fun and I didn\u2019t have any bad experiences with people dropping out or doing other stupid things, which is what I have been pretty accustom to with other online gaming experiences I have tried. I didn\u2019t really notice any lagging issues, and I was using wireless internet. Very impressed! Let me finish by saying that I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Wii and was on the fence with the Wii U. This is one of the titles that swayed my decision to buy it - and I have no regrets!"]}, {"Username":["Hawke525"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Beautiful graphics, gameplay is awesome, much more balanced.

The transitions into flying, underwater, standard driving, and hovering are seamless, and flow perfectly! The level design is ingenious and is an absolute thrill! On most of the new courses there are many different paths, short cuts allowing for continuous exploration and variability. The retro courses too have been reworked a bit, keeping the same feel and theme but restructured a bit to maximize the use of the many abilities that the Mario Kart 8 Karts and bikes have, and instead of compromising the integrity of the classics, it simply redefines them while remaining true to the heritage. Also, on a side not, the instant replay is awesome! It is hilarious to slow the camera just as you get smacked with a turtle shell and watch the character's expressions! Overall great game!

It's a lot of fun and the online racing helps build some competitive nature in my son. Whenever I'm unable to play the game with him, and he's tired of beating up on the computers, it helps that he can go online to play against other people. He can vote for what map he wants to play, and its randomly selected so there's no Tyranny of the Majority going on (where a single map may get chosen indefinitely). There are a lot of variations of karts, gliders, wheels to unlock, as well as characters. I've heard rumors there may be DLC coming for the game as well - I don't know what it will consist of but I'm sure my son will be begging me to buy it, and I probably will. The replay value is very high, and if your kids have friends, they will all enjoy playing this game together.

Starkey"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I'll start off first by saying that the graphical leap is astounding. Sometimes I drive off the side of the course because I get stuck admiring the backgrounds and all the attention to detail. This game is gorgeous! Now that I've got that out of the way, I have quite a few criticisms of this game which I'd like to mention. First, I'm really disappointed with the character roster, despite having 29 characters (excluding your Mii) to choose from. I don't believe that the Koopalings are a very good addition to the game, at least not good enough to take up seven spaces when they could have brought back Bowser Jr and had space for six more characters. They should have brought back Birdo, Diddy Kong, Dry Bones, and King Boo. Maybe even included some characters like Dixie Kong and Kamek. Also, Metal Mario, Pink Gold Peach and Baby Rosalina seem a bit unnecessary to me. I'm holding out hope that some of these characters may be released later on through DLC. Secondly, the Battle mode feels stripped down compared to what it used to be. There are no more mode-specific arenas in which to compete and that feels like a step back for the series. Some people are claiming Battle mode has been ruined by this game. In my opinion, that's too harsh. It's not been ruined, but it just isn't as good as it once was. This can hopefully be remedied by a patch or DLC in the future as well. Now for the gameplay. There is a very minimal learning curve to this game as it plays almost the same as all entries before it. My sister and I used to play MK64 and Double Dash together while we were growing up. Both she and my nephew were able to pick up a controller and start playing with ease. She was happy with the additions of the underwater portions, the zero-gravity gimmick and the addition of so many new items. We played for about five hours so far and had a blast. The bottom line is, if you're a Mario Kart fan, this game should not disappoint you. If you're a Wii U owner and looking for a fun game to play with your kids and/or family, this is an excellent choice as there is fun to be had by all with this game. Personally, I'm very happy with 8, although the few gripes I have with it keep it from being my favorite entry. It's nice to have a shiny new game to play on my Wii U, but as good as it is, I don't believe this is the system-seller that Nintendo was hoping for. Still, don't hesitate to purchase this game if you're looking for some accessible, family-friendly fun. Enjoy!"]}]
[{"Username":["CynicalKiwi"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["From what I've experienced so far, this is definitely one of my favorite Mario Kart games. I daresay it bypasses even Mario Kart Wii--my previous favorite. The graphics, soundtrack, and track design are all amazing. The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc). My one complaint is Battle Mode.

You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died.

Well. Some of them. Just the ones I was a jerk to. ANYWAY. During my college years I began to improve my Mario Kart skills with Double Dash. Strange things started happening. Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart.

This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people.

Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game. It is really cool to be able to race NPC's than compare your skills to real people."]}, {"Username":["K. Lovick \"Keen Queen\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["My kids and I have been anxiously waiting this game for months. Yes, it is worth the wait. This game is awesome and epic all at the same time. The one thing I always like to point out that when Nintendo makes a game, they put their heart and soul into it. The graphics and music is amazing. The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games. In fact, I like how the customization of your kart and the track differences effect the outcome. Time flies when playing this game. Thank you Nintendo for making a great game!"]}, {"Username":["Miles B."],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Mario Kart 8 is a great addition to the WiiU. The graphics for this game are very well polished and the colors definitely grab your attention. This game feels almost exactly like Mario Kart 7, but it has it's perks compared to the 3DS Mario Kart. One being that there are bikes in this game, but better than the Wii Version because both types of vehicles are decently comparable in performance. In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels. I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors. All-in-all, I give Mario Kart 8 a resounding five stars, and I would most definitely recommend this to anyone that may or may not have a WiiU yet."]}, {"Username":["Cory"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["MK8 is absolutely phenomenal and Wii U is the best gaming system out there. MK8 has 32 brilliant tracks that are so rich that they're hard to master completely. Each level has so many different variables, short cuts, and strategies by the computer that you will never get bored. And 150CC mode is hard enough that it will have you playing over and over trying to earn all of the gold trophies. Plus, every Grand Prix you finish opens up new characters and vehicle mods. Lastly, Online play is fantastic and loads of fun. This game is the most beautiful game I've played, so ridiculously fun, and addicting.

I just played 12 races, and there was a MAXIMUM of one blue shell per race, And that a huge Deal for 150cc.

Despite the fact that I have far, far fewer friends in my life that are willing to play Mario Kart with me now than I did with the N64 game, I actually think this is a better Mario Kart than any that have come before. It outranks my hyperbolic memories of yesteryear. I just wish I had more people to play it with. If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1.

First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days. Follow that with the N64 version, which in my opinion, was one of the hugest leaps forward in arcade / party racing for its time. After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right. I wasn\u2019t able to change the button configuration\u2026 I would have been curious to see how it felt using a \u2018trigger\u2019 button as the gas instead of the \u2018A\u2019 button \u2013 but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race! It is very fun and I didn\u2019t have any bad experiences with people dropping out or doing other stupid things, which is what I have been pretty accustom to with other online gaming experiences I have tried. I didn\u2019t really notice any lagging issues, and I was using wireless internet. Very impressed! Let me finish by saying that I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Wii and was on the fence with the Wii U.

The transitions into flying, underwater, standard driving, and hovering are seamless, and flow perfectly! The level design is ingenious and is an absolute thrill! On most of the new courses there are many different paths, short cuts allowing for continuous exploration and variability. The retro courses too have been reworked a bit, keeping the same feel and theme but restructured a bit to maximize the use of the many abilities that the Mario Kart 8 Karts and bikes have, and instead of compromising the integrity of the classics, it simply redefines them while remaining true to the heritage. Also, on a side not, the instant replay is awesome! It is hilarious to slow the camera just as you get smacked with a turtle shell and watch the character's expressions! Overall great game!

Starkey"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I'll start off first by saying that the graphical leap is astounding. Sometimes I drive off the side of the course because I get stuck admiring the backgrounds and all the attention to detail. This game is gorgeous! Now that I've got that out of the way, I have quite a few criticisms of this game which I'd like to mention. First, I'm really disappointed with the character roster, despite having 29 characters (excluding your Mii) to choose from. I don't believe that the Koopalings are a very good addition to the game, at least not good enough to take up seven spaces when they could have brought back Bowser Jr and had space for six more characters. They should have brought back Birdo, Diddy Kong, Dry Bones, and King Boo. Maybe even included some characters like Dixie Kong and Kamek. Also, Metal Mario, Pink Gold Peach and Baby Rosalina seem a bit unnecessary to me. I'm holding out hope that some of these characters may be released later on through DLC. Secondly, the Battle mode feels stripped down compared to what it used to be. There are no more mode-specific arenas in which to compete and that feels like a step back for the series. Some people are claiming Battle mode has been ruined by this game. In my opinion, that's too harsh. It's not been ruined, but it just isn't as good as it once was. This can hopefully be remedied by a patch or DLC in the future as well. Now for the gameplay. There is a very minimal learning curve to this game as it plays almost the same as all entries before it. My sister and I used to play MK64 and Double Dash together while we were growing up. Both she and my nephew were able to pick up a controller and start playing with ease. She was happy with the additions of the underwater portions, the zero-gravity gimmick and the addition of so many new items. We played for about five hours so far and had a blast. The bottom line is, if you're a Mario Kart fan, this game should not disappoint you. If you're a Wii U owner and looking for a fun game to play with your kids and/or family, this is an excellent choice as there is fun to be had by all with this game. Personally, I'm very happy with 8, although the few gripes I have with it keep it from being my favorite entry. It's nice to have a shiny new game to play on my Wii U, but as good as it is, I don't believe this is the system-seller that Nintendo was hoping for.

I daresay it bypasses even Mario Kart Wii--my previous favorite. The graphics, soundtrack, and track design are all amazing. The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc). My one complaint is Battle Mode.

You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died.

Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart.

This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people.

Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games. In fact, I like how the customization of your kart and the track differences effect the outcome. Time flies when playing this game. Thank you Nintendo for making a great game!"]}, {"Username":["Miles B."],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Mario Kart 8 is a great addition to the WiiU. The graphics for this game are very well polished and the colors definitely grab your attention. This game feels almost exactly like Mario Kart 7, but it has it's perks compared to the 3DS Mario Kart. One being that there are bikes in this game, but better than the Wii Version because both types of vehicles are decently comparable in performance. In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels. I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors. All-in-all, I give Mario Kart 8 a resounding five stars, and I would most definitely recommend this to anyone that may or may not have a WiiU yet."]}, {"Username":["Cory"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["MK8 is absolutely phenomenal and Wii U is the best gaming system out there. MK8 has 32 brilliant tracks that are so rich that they're hard to master completely. Each level has so many different variables, short cuts, and strategies by the computer that you will never get bored. And 150CC mode is hard enough that it will have you playing over and over trying to earn all of the gold trophies. Plus, every Grand Prix you finish opens up new characters and vehicle mods. Lastly, Online play is fantastic and loads of fun. This game is the most beautiful game I've played, so ridiculously fun, and addicting. I can't wait to see what else Nintendo has to offer now and in the future!

I just played 12 races, and there was a MAXIMUM of one blue shell per race, And that a huge Deal for 150cc. The Good! +items balanced more, less blue shells,and other overpowered item frequency (I only tested 150cc, but should be similar on others) +Also the ability to change the item set for multi-player is great. +You get a free game with it (But the UK has a better selection) +You can customize your carts, and it offers way more unlocks +The controls feel tighter, and you can use any controller type that the WiiU supports +Great music +You can kill the blue shell! + 60 fps! The bad: -The game runs at 720p even on 1080p tv's, and it's quite noticeable on larger screen tv's, (but you get some AA as a trade off, so it's not a huge deal) --Edit: it dose not have AA (thanks Vanilla) -- -Feels a bit too much like it's predecessors, (Feels like a patched, 720p MK wii, with a few extra features) -kart customization breaks character diversity, (not really a bad thing per say, but in the past each character had his/her own advantage, not any more) -no True item switch, you can only switch on/off a group of items, (would have been better to use a SSB style toggle system -unlock descriptions? (just like the other games, it dose not tell you how to unlock character or parts, or even how close you are to an unlock) -The roster... (they filled it up with koopalings, and a metal peach, there are so many other thing they could have added) -Battle mode (what happened to fighting in arenas??) --Summary-- Overall a very fun game, It feels much less random then Mario Kart Wii, and it's a lot of fun, whether your a Mario kart fan! or have not played since mk64 or DD, You'll enjoy this game none-the-less.

Despite the fact that I have far, far fewer friends in my life that are willing to play Mario Kart with me now than I did with the N64 game, I actually think this is a better Mario Kart than any that have come before. It outranks my hyperbolic memories of yesteryear. I just wish I had more people to play it with. If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1. One of the reviews said that you can't go shopping and turtle shells represent animal abuse...But anyway, this is definitely the best mario kart game to date. First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

Onwards to Smash Bros and Zelda!!"]}, {"Username":["Nutwiisystem.Com"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["It's no secret that the Wii U has been struggling. Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days. Follow that with the N64 version, which in my opinion, was one of the hugest leaps forward in arcade / party racing for its time. After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right. I wasn\u2019t able to change the button configuration\u2026 I would have been curious to see how it felt using a \u2018trigger\u2019 button as the gas instead of the \u2018A\u2019 button \u2013 but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race! It is very fun and I didn\u2019t have any bad experiences with people dropping out or doing other stupid things, which is what I have been pretty accustom to with other online gaming experiences I have tried. I didn\u2019t really notice any lagging issues, and I was using wireless internet. Very impressed! Let me finish by saying that I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Wii and was on the fence with the Wii U.

On most of the new courses there are many different paths, short cuts allowing for continuous exploration and variability. The retro courses too have been reworked a bit, keeping the same feel and theme but restructured a bit to maximize the use of the many abilities that the Mario Kart 8 Karts and bikes have, and instead of compromising the integrity of the classics, it simply redefines them while remaining true to the heritage. Also, on a side not, the instant replay is awesome! It is hilarious to slow the camera just as you get smacked with a turtle shell and watch the character's expressions! Overall great game!

He can vote for what map he wants to play, and its randomly selected so there's no Tyranny of the Majority going on (where a single map may get chosen indefinitely). There are a lot of variations of karts, gliders, wheels to unlock, as well as characters.

Starkey"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I'll start off first by saying that the graphical leap is astounding. Sometimes I drive off the side of the course because I get stuck admiring the backgrounds and all the attention to detail. This game is gorgeous! Now that I've got that out of the way, I have quite a few criticisms of this game which I'd like to mention. First, I'm really disappointed with the character roster, despite having 29 characters (excluding your Mii) to choose from. I don't believe that the Koopalings are a very good addition to the game, at least not good enough to take up seven spaces when they could have brought back Bowser Jr and had space for six more characters. They should have brought back Birdo, Diddy Kong, Dry Bones, and King Boo. Maybe even included some characters like Dixie Kong and Kamek. Also, Metal Mario, Pink Gold Peach and Baby Rosalina seem a bit unnecessary to me. I'm holding out hope that some of these characters may be released later on through DLC. Secondly, the Battle mode feels stripped down compared to what it used to be. There are no more mode-specific arenas in which to compete and that feels like a step back for the series. Some people are claiming Battle mode has been ruined by this game. In my opinion, that's too harsh. It's not been ruined, but it just isn't as good as it once was. This can hopefully be remedied by a patch or DLC in the future as well. Now for the gameplay. There is a very minimal learning curve to this game as it plays almost the same as all entries before it. My sister and I used to play MK64 and Double Dash together while we were growing up. Both she and my nephew were able to pick up a controller and start playing with ease. She was happy with the additions of the underwater portions, the zero-gravity gimmick and the addition of so many new items. We played for about five hours so far and had a blast. The bottom line is, if you're a Mario Kart fan, this game should not disappoint you. If you're a Wii U owner and looking for a fun game to play with your kids and/or family, this is an excellent choice as there is fun to be had by all with this game. Personally, I'm very happy with 8, although the few gripes I have with it keep it from being my favorite entry. It's nice to have a shiny new game to play on my Wii U, but as good as it is, I don't believe this is the system-seller that Nintendo was hoping for.

The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc).

You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated.

This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people.

Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

In fact, I like how the customization of your kart and the track differences effect the outcome. Time flies when playing this game.

The graphics for this game are very well polished and the colors definitely grab your attention. This game feels almost exactly like Mario Kart 7, but it has it's perks compared to the 3DS Mario Kart. One being that there are bikes in this game, but better than the Wii Version because both types of vehicles are decently comparable in performance. In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels. I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors. All-in-all, I give Mario Kart 8 a resounding five stars, and I would most definitely recommend this to anyone that may or may not have a WiiU yet."]}, {"Username":["Cory"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["MK8 is absolutely phenomenal and Wii U is the best gaming system out there. MK8 has 32 brilliant tracks that are so rich that they're hard to master completely. Each level has so many different variables, short cuts, and strategies by the computer that you will never get bored. And 150CC mode is hard enough that it will have you playing over and over trying to earn all of the gold trophies. Plus, every Grand Prix you finish opens up new characters and vehicle mods. Lastly, Online play is fantastic and loads of fun. This game is the most beautiful game I've played, so ridiculously fun, and addicting.

I just played 12 races, and there was a MAXIMUM of one blue shell per race, And that a huge Deal for 150cc. The Good! +items balanced more, less blue shells,and other overpowered item frequency (I only tested 150cc, but should be similar on others) +Also the ability to change the item set for multi-player is great. +You get a free game with it (But the UK has a better selection) +You can customize your carts, and it offers way more unlocks +The controls feel tighter, and you can use any controller type that the WiiU supports +Great music +You can kill the blue shell! + 60 fps!

(just like the other games, it dose not tell you how to unlock character or parts, or even how close you are to an unlock) -The roster... (they filled it up with koopalings, and a metal peach, there are so many other thing they could have added) -Battle mode (what happened to fighting in arenas??) --Summary-- Overall a very fun game, It feels much less random then Mario Kart Wii, and it's a lot of fun, whether your a Mario kart fan! or have not played since mk64 or DD, You'll enjoy this game none-the-less.

Despite the fact that I have far, far fewer friends in my life that are willing to play Mario Kart with me now than I did with the N64 game, I actually think this is a better Mario Kart than any that have come before. It outranks my hyperbolic memories of yesteryear. I just wish I had more people to play it with. If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1. One of the reviews said that you can't go shopping and turtle shells represent animal abuse...But anyway, this is definitely the best mario kart game to date. First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

Onwards to Smash Bros and Zelda!!"]}, {"Username":["Nutwiisystem.Com"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["It's no secret that the Wii U has been struggling. Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days. Follow that with the N64 version, which in my opinion, was one of the hugest leaps forward in arcade / party racing for its time. After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right. I wasn\u2019t able to change the button configuration\u2026 I would have been curious to see how it felt using a \u2018trigger\u2019 button as the gas instead of the \u2018A\u2019 button \u2013 but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race! It is very fun and I didn\u2019t have any bad experiences with people dropping out or doing other stupid things, which is what I have been pretty accustom to with other online gaming experiences I have tried. I didn\u2019t really notice any lagging issues, and I was using wireless internet. Very impressed! Let me finish by saying that I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Wii and was on the fence with the Wii U.

On most of the new courses there are many different paths, short cuts allowing for continuous exploration and variability. The retro courses too have been reworked a bit, keeping the same feel and theme but restructured a bit to maximize the use of the many abilities that the Mario Kart 8 Karts and bikes have, and instead of compromising the integrity of the classics, it simply redefines them while remaining true to the heritage. Also, on a side not, the instant replay is awesome! It is hilarious to slow the camera just as you get smacked with a turtle shell and watch the character's expressions! Overall great game!

He can vote for what map he wants to play, and its randomly selected so there's no Tyranny of the Majority going on (where a single map may get chosen indefinitely). There are a lot of variations of karts, gliders, wheels to unlock, as well as characters. I've heard rumors there may be DLC coming for the game as well - I don't know what it will consist of but I'm sure my son will be begging me to buy it, and I probably will. The replay value is very high, and if your kids have friends, they will all enjoy playing this game together.

Starkey"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I'll start off first by saying that the graphical leap is astounding. Sometimes I drive off the side of the course because I get stuck admiring the backgrounds and all the attention to detail. This game is gorgeous! Now that I've got that out of the way, I have quite a few criticisms of this game which I'd like to mention. First, I'm really disappointed with the character roster, despite having 29 characters (excluding your Mii) to choose from. I don't believe that the Koopalings are a very good addition to the game, at least not good enough to take up seven spaces when they could have brought back Bowser Jr and had space for six more characters. They should have brought back Birdo, Diddy Kong, Dry Bones, and King Boo. Maybe even included some characters like Dixie Kong and Kamek. Also, Metal Mario, Pink Gold Peach and Baby Rosalina seem a bit unnecessary to me. I'm holding out hope that some of these characters may be released later on through DLC. Secondly, the Battle mode feels stripped down compared to what it used to be. There are no more mode-specific arenas in which to compete and that feels like a step back for the series. Some people are claiming Battle mode has been ruined by this game. In my opinion, that's too harsh. It's not been ruined, but it just isn't as good as it once was. This can hopefully be remedied by a patch or DLC in the future as well. Now for the gameplay. There is a very minimal learning curve to this game as it plays almost the same as all entries before it. My sister and I used to play MK64 and Double Dash together while we were growing up. Both she and my nephew were able to pick up a controller and start playing with ease. She was happy with the additions of the underwater portions, the zero-gravity gimmick and the addition of so many new items. We played for about five hours so far and had a blast. The bottom line is, if you're a Mario Kart fan, this game should not disappoint you. If you're a Wii U owner and looking for a fun game to play with your kids and/or family, this is an excellent choice as there is fun to be had by all with this game. Personally, I'm very happy with 8, although the few gripes I have with it keep it from being my favorite entry. It's nice to have a shiny new game to play on my Wii U, but as good as it is, I don't believe this is the system-seller that Nintendo was hoping for.

The game also supports off-TV play, so you can play on only the Gamepad if you want to (as long as your Gamepad is within range of your Wii U; range varies depending on wall thickness, amount of obstructions, etc).

You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2. Is it me, or do I not have complete control of my power slide - power up? In the 64 version, I could do left -right - left - right and BOOM. In this one ( and the DS versions) I'm not sure if I have complete control over this function or if it somewhat automated. It feels automated, as in I have to be sliding for a long enough period of time for the full boost to kick in.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died.

Ladies started to like me. I got good grades. I began singing and dancing. Finally I met the girl of my dreams. She liked Mario Kart. I was on to something. We married. Had 3 children. Still played Mario Kart. Coincidence? I think not. Then I heard about Mario Kart 8. Upside down driving. Beautiful graphics. A free game from Nintendo just for buying... Of course I couldn't pass it up. To say I am most please is an understatement. This game has turned me into a new man. I have recently finished writing 11 chapters of my book. Why? Mario Kart. I have moved from being a third grade teacher to a sixth grade teacher. Why? Do we need to ask? Mario Kart. My children just nominated me for Dad of the Year in our House. Why? Because of Mario Kart.

This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people. But if you play this game, it will drag out the most repressed psychotic foul mouthed hate demon that dwells in the deepest recesses of your soul and set it free amongst a world of bright colors and cheery cartoon characters. And chances are, you will enjoy yourself."]}, {"Username":["Ryan P. Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games. In fact, I like how the customization of your kart and the track differences effect the outcome. Time flies when playing this game. Thank you Nintendo for making a great game!"]}, {"Username":["Miles B."],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Mario Kart 8 is a great addition to the WiiU. The graphics for this game are very well polished and the colors definitely grab your attention. This game feels almost exactly like Mario Kart 7, but it has it's perks compared to the 3DS Mario Kart. One being that there are bikes in this game, but better than the Wii Version because both types of vehicles are decently comparable in performance. In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels. I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors. All-in-all, I give Mario Kart 8 a resounding five stars, and I would most definitely recommend this to anyone that may or may not have a WiiU yet."]}, {"Username":["Cory"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["MK8 is absolutely phenomenal and Wii U is the best gaming system out there. MK8 has 32 brilliant tracks that are so rich that they're hard to master completely. Each level has so many different variables, short cuts, and strategies by the computer that you will never get bored. And 150CC mode is hard enough that it will have you playing over and over trying to earn all of the gold trophies. Plus, every Grand Prix you finish opens up new characters and vehicle mods. Lastly, Online play is fantastic and loads of fun. This game is the most beautiful game I've played, so ridiculously fun, and addicting.

I just played 12 races, and there was a MAXIMUM of one blue shell per race, And that a huge Deal for 150cc. The Good! +items balanced more, less blue shells,and other overpowered item frequency (I only tested 150cc, but should be similar on others) +Also the ability to change the item set for multi-player is great. +You get a free game with it (But the UK has a better selection) +You can customize your carts, and it offers way more unlocks +The controls feel tighter, and you can use any controller type that the WiiU supports +Great music +You can kill the blue shell! + 60 fps! The bad: -The game runs at 720p even on 1080p tv's, and it's quite noticeable on larger screen tv's, (but you get some AA as a trade off, so it's not a huge deal) --Edit: it dose not have AA (thanks Vanilla) -- -Feels a bit too much like it's predecessors, (Feels like a patched, 720p MK wii, with a few extra features) -kart customization breaks character diversity, (not really a bad thing per say, but in the past each character had his/her own advantage, not any more) -no True item switch, you can only switch on/off a group of items, (would have been better to use a SSB style toggle system -unlock descriptions? (just like the other games, it dose not tell you how to unlock character or parts, or even how close you are to an unlock) -The roster... (they filled it up with koopalings, and a metal peach, there are so many other thing they could have added) -Battle mode (what happened to fighting in arenas??) --Summary-- Overall a very fun game, It feels much less random then Mario Kart Wii, and it's a lot of fun, whether your a Mario kart fan! or have not played since mk64 or DD, You'll enjoy this game none-the-less.

Despite the fact that I have far, far fewer friends in my life that are willing to play Mario Kart with me now than I did with the N64 game, I actually think this is a better Mario Kart than any that have come before. It outranks my hyperbolic memories of yesteryear. I just wish I had more people to play it with. If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1.

First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

Onwards to Smash Bros and Zelda!!"]}, {"Username":["Nutwiisystem.Com"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["It's no secret that the Wii U has been struggling. Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days. Follow that with the N64 version, which in my opinion, was one of the hugest leaps forward in arcade / party racing for its time. After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right. I wasn\u2019t able to change the button configuration\u2026 I would have been curious to see how it felt using a \u2018trigger\u2019 button as the gas instead of the \u2018A\u2019 button \u2013 but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race! It is very fun and I didn\u2019t have any bad experiences with people dropping out or doing other stupid things, which is what I have been pretty accustom to with other online gaming experiences I have tried. I didn\u2019t really notice any lagging issues, and I was using wireless internet. Very impressed! Let me finish by saying that I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Wii and was on the fence with the Wii U.

On most of the new courses there are many different paths, short cuts allowing for continuous exploration and variability. The retro courses too have been reworked a bit, keeping the same feel and theme but restructured a bit to maximize the use of the many abilities that the Mario Kart 8 Karts and bikes have, and instead of compromising the integrity of the classics, it simply redefines them while remaining true to the heritage. Also, on a side not, the instant replay is awesome! It is hilarious to slow the camera just as you get smacked with a turtle shell and watch the character's expressions! Overall great game!

He can vote for what map he wants to play, and its randomly selected so there's no Tyranny of the Majority going on (where a single map may get chosen indefinitely). There are a lot of variations of karts, gliders, wheels to unlock, as well as characters.

Starkey"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I'll start off first by saying that the graphical leap is astounding. Sometimes I drive off the side of the course because I get stuck admiring the backgrounds and all the attention to detail. This game is gorgeous! Now that I've got that out of the way, I have quite a few criticisms of this game which I'd like to mention. First, I'm really disappointed with the character roster, despite having 29 characters (excluding your Mii) to choose from. I don't believe that the Koopalings are a very good addition to the game, at least not good enough to take up seven spaces when they could have brought back Bowser Jr and had space for six more characters. They should have brought back Birdo, Diddy Kong, Dry Bones, and King Boo. Maybe even included some characters like Dixie Kong and Kamek. Also, Metal Mario, Pink Gold Peach and Baby Rosalina seem a bit unnecessary to me. I'm holding out hope that some of these characters may be released later on through DLC. Secondly, the Battle mode feels stripped down compared to what it used to be. There are no more mode-specific arenas in which to compete and that feels like a step back for the series. Some people are claiming Battle mode has been ruined by this game. In my opinion, that's too harsh. It's not been ruined, but it just isn't as good as it once was. This can hopefully be remedied by a patch or DLC in the future as well. Now for the gameplay. There is a very minimal learning curve to this game as it plays almost the same as all entries before it. My sister and I used to play MK64 and Double Dash together while we were growing up. Both she and my nephew were able to pick up a controller and start playing with ease. She was happy with the additions of the underwater portions, the zero-gravity gimmick and the addition of so many new items. We played for about five hours so far and had a blast. The bottom line is, if you're a Mario Kart fan, this game should not disappoint you. If you're a Wii U owner and looking for a fun game to play with your kids and/or family, this is an excellent choice as there is fun to be had by all with this game. Personally, I'm very happy with 8, although the few gripes I have with it keep it from being my favorite entry. It's nice to have a shiny new game to play on my Wii U, but as good as it is, I don't believe this is the system-seller that Nintendo was hoping for.

You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people.

Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

This game is awesome and epic all at the same time. The one thing I always like to point out that when Nintendo makes a game, they put their heart and soul into it. The graphics and music is amazing. The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games. In fact, I like how the customization of your kart and the track differences effect the outcome. Time flies when playing this game. Thank you Nintendo for making a great game!"]}, {"Username":["Miles B."],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Mario Kart 8 is a great addition to the WiiU. The graphics for this game are very well polished and the colors definitely grab your attention. This game feels almost exactly like Mario Kart 7, but it has it's perks compared to the 3DS Mario Kart. One being that there are bikes in this game, but better than the Wii Version because both types of vehicles are decently comparable in performance. In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels. I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors. All-in-all, I give Mario Kart 8 a resounding five stars, and I would most definitely recommend this to anyone that may or may not have a WiiU yet."]}, {"Username":["Cory"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["MK8 is absolutely phenomenal and Wii U is the best gaming system out there. MK8 has 32 brilliant tracks that are so rich that they're hard to master completely. Each level has so many different variables, short cuts, and strategies by the computer that you will never get bored. And 150CC mode is hard enough that it will have you playing over and over trying to earn all of the gold trophies. Plus, every Grand Prix you finish opens up new characters and vehicle mods. Lastly, Online play is fantastic and loads of fun. This game is the most beautiful game I've played, so ridiculously fun, and addicting.

I just played 12 races, and there was a MAXIMUM of one blue shell per race, And that a huge Deal for 150cc.

Despite the fact that I have far, far fewer friends in my life that are willing to play Mario Kart with me now than I did with the N64 game, I actually think this is a better Mario Kart than any that have come before. It outranks my hyperbolic memories of yesteryear. I just wish I had more people to play it with. If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1.

First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

Onwards to Smash Bros and Zelda!!"]}, {"Username":["Nutwiisystem.Com"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["It's no secret that the Wii U has been struggling. Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days. Follow that with the N64 version, which in my opinion, was one of the hugest leaps forward in arcade / party racing for its time. After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right. I wasn\u2019t able to change the button configuration\u2026 I would have been curious to see how it felt using a \u2018trigger\u2019 button as the gas instead of the \u2018A\u2019 button \u2013 but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race! It is very fun and I didn\u2019t have any bad experiences with people dropping out or doing other stupid things, which is what I have been pretty accustom to with other online gaming experiences I have tried. I didn\u2019t really notice any lagging issues, and I was using wireless internet. Very impressed! Let me finish by saying that I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Wii and was on the fence with the Wii U.

The transitions into flying, underwater, standard driving, and hovering are seamless, and flow perfectly! The level design is ingenious and is an absolute thrill! On most of the new courses there are many different paths, short cuts allowing for continuous exploration and variability. The retro courses too have been reworked a bit, keeping the same feel and theme but restructured a bit to maximize the use of the many abilities that the Mario Kart 8 Karts and bikes have, and instead of compromising the integrity of the classics, it simply redefines them while remaining true to the heritage. Also, on a side not, the instant replay is awesome! It is hilarious to slow the camera just as you get smacked with a turtle shell and watch the character's expressions! Overall great game!

You have to unlock most of the tracks. You get to unlock karts... and tires... and parasails. It really gives you more reason to play and a greater sense of accomplishment.

Whenever I'm unable to play the game with him, and he's tired of beating up on the computers, it helps that he can go online to play against other people. He can vote for what map he wants to play, and its randomly selected so there's no Tyranny of the Majority going on (where a single map may get chosen indefinitely). There are a lot of variations of karts, gliders, wheels to unlock, as well as characters. I've heard rumors there may be DLC coming for the game as well - I don't know what it will consist of but I'm sure my son will be begging me to buy it, and I probably will. The replay value is very high, and if your kids have friends, they will all enjoy playing this game together.

Starkey"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I'll start off first by saying that the graphical leap is astounding. Sometimes I drive off the side of the course because I get stuck admiring the backgrounds and all the attention to detail. This game is gorgeous! Now that I've got that out of the way, I have quite a few criticisms of this game which I'd like to mention. First, I'm really disappointed with the character roster, despite having 29 characters (excluding your Mii) to choose from. I don't believe that the Koopalings are a very good addition to the game, at least not good enough to take up seven spaces when they could have brought back Bowser Jr and had space for six more characters. They should have brought back Birdo, Diddy Kong, Dry Bones, and King Boo. Maybe even included some characters like Dixie Kong and Kamek. Also, Metal Mario, Pink Gold Peach and Baby Rosalina seem a bit unnecessary to me. I'm holding out hope that some of these characters may be released later on through DLC. Secondly, the Battle mode feels stripped down compared to what it used to be. There are no more mode-specific arenas in which to compete and that feels like a step back for the series. Some people are claiming Battle mode has been ruined by this game. In my opinion, that's too harsh. It's not been ruined, but it just isn't as good as it once was. This can hopefully be remedied by a patch or DLC in the future as well. Now for the gameplay. There is a very minimal learning curve to this game as it plays almost the same as all entries before it. My sister and I used to play MK64 and Double Dash together while we were growing up. Both she and my nephew were able to pick up a controller and start playing with ease. She was happy with the additions of the underwater portions, the zero-gravity gimmick and the addition of so many new items. We played for about five hours so far and had a blast. The bottom line is, if you're a Mario Kart fan, this game should not disappoint you. If you're a Wii U owner and looking for a fun game to play with your kids and/or family, this is an excellent choice as there is fun to be had by all with this game. Personally, I'm very happy with 8, although the few gripes I have with it keep it from being my favorite entry. It's nice to have a shiny new game to play on my Wii U, but as good as it is, I don't believe this is the system-seller that Nintendo was hoping for.

You will need a little weapon luck to finish in first place. 2. The graphics are awesome. I was particularly impressed with how they revised \"Sherbet Land.\" 3. If you fall off the track, there is a much faster mechanism in place to get you back in the race. Things I am not sure about: 1. Don't really care about customization of the car. 2.

Many years ago, I was a Mario Kart LOSER. I only had friends that would invite me over so they could smear my face into the pavement in Mario Kart on the SNES. My grades suffered. My cats died.

This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo. - No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people.

Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game. It is really cool to be able to race NPC's than compare your skills to real people."]}, {"Username":["K. Lovick \"Keen Queen\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["My kids and I have been anxiously waiting this game for months. Yes, it is worth the wait. This game is awesome and epic all at the same time. The one thing I always like to point out that when Nintendo makes a game, they put their heart and soul into it. The graphics and music is amazing. The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games. In fact, I like how the customization of your kart and the track differences effect the outcome. Time flies when playing this game. Thank you Nintendo for making a great game!"]}, {"Username":["Miles B."],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Mario Kart 8 is a great addition to the WiiU. The graphics for this game are very well polished and the colors definitely grab your attention. This game feels almost exactly like Mario Kart 7, but it has it's perks compared to the 3DS Mario Kart. One being that there are bikes in this game, but better than the Wii Version because both types of vehicles are decently comparable in performance. In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels. I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors. All-in-all, I give Mario Kart 8 a resounding five stars, and I would most definitely recommend this to anyone that may or may not have a WiiU yet."]}, {"Username":["Cory"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["MK8 is absolutely phenomenal and Wii U is the best gaming system out there. MK8 has 32 brilliant tracks that are so rich that they're hard to master completely.

And 150CC mode is hard enough that it will have you playing over and over trying to earn all of the gold trophies. Plus, every Grand Prix you finish opens up new characters and vehicle mods. Lastly, Online play is fantastic and loads of fun. This game is the most beautiful game I've played, so ridiculously fun, and addicting.

Despite the fact that I have far, far fewer friends in my life that are willing to play Mario Kart with me now than I did with the N64 game, I actually think this is a better Mario Kart than any that have come before. It outranks my hyperbolic memories of yesteryear. I just wish I had more people to play it with. If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1.

First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days. Follow that with the N64 version, which in my opinion, was one of the hugest leaps forward in arcade / party racing for its time. After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right. I wasn\u2019t able to change the button configuration\u2026 I would have been curious to see how it felt using a \u2018trigger\u2019 button as the gas instead of the \u2018A\u2019 button \u2013 but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race! It is very fun and I didn\u2019t have any bad experiences with people dropping out or doing other stupid things, which is what I have been pretty accustom to with other online gaming experiences I have tried. I didn\u2019t really notice any lagging issues, and I was using wireless internet. Very impressed! Let me finish by saying that I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Wii and was on the fence with the Wii U. This is one of the titles that swayed my decision to buy it - and I have no regrets!"]}, {"Username":["Hawke525"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Beautiful graphics, gameplay is awesome, much more balanced. Music is also huge plus. Another praise I'll give is the online experience. Connecting is much quicker and during races, it was smooth. It does feel different so you'll have to get use to it for a bit. But once you do. You'll want to play this over MK Wii. Another complaint is that there's too many baby characters and koopas imo.

The transitions into flying, underwater, standard driving, and hovering are seamless, and flow perfectly! The level design is ingenious and is an absolute thrill! On most of the new courses there are many different paths, short cuts allowing for continuous exploration and variability. The retro courses too have been reworked a bit, keeping the same feel and theme but restructured a bit to maximize the use of the many abilities that the Mario Kart 8 Karts and bikes have, and instead of compromising the integrity of the classics, it simply redefines them while remaining true to the heritage. Also, on a side not, the instant replay is awesome! It is hilarious to slow the camera just as you get smacked with a turtle shell and watch the character's expressions! Overall great game!

You have to unlock most of the tracks. You get to unlock karts... and tires... and parasails. It really gives you more reason to play and a greater sense of accomplishment.

He can vote for what map he wants to play, and its randomly selected so there's no Tyranny of the Majority going on (where a single map may get chosen indefinitely). There are a lot of variations of karts, gliders, wheels to unlock, as well as characters. I've heard rumors there may be DLC coming for the game as well - I don't know what it will consist of but I'm sure my son will be begging me to buy it, and I probably will. The replay value is very high, and if your kids have friends, they will all enjoy playing this game together.

Starkey"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I'll start off first by saying that the graphical leap is astounding. Sometimes I drive off the side of the course because I get stuck admiring the backgrounds and all the attention to detail. This game is gorgeous! Now that I've got that out of the way, I have quite a few criticisms of this game which I'd like to mention. First, I'm really disappointed with the character roster, despite having 29 characters (excluding your Mii) to choose from. I don't believe that the Koopalings are a very good addition to the game, at least not good enough to take up seven spaces when they could have brought back Bowser Jr and had space for six more characters. They should have brought back Birdo, Diddy Kong, Dry Bones, and King Boo. Maybe even included some characters like Dixie Kong and Kamek. Also, Metal Mario, Pink Gold Peach and Baby Rosalina seem a bit unnecessary to me. I'm holding out hope that some of these characters may be released later on through DLC. Secondly, the Battle mode feels stripped down compared to what it used to be. There are no more mode-specific arenas in which to compete and that feels like a step back for the series. Some people are claiming Battle mode has been ruined by this game. In my opinion, that's too harsh. It's not been ruined, but it just isn't as good as it once was. This can hopefully be remedied by a patch or DLC in the future as well. Now for the gameplay. There is a very minimal learning curve to this game as it plays almost the same as all entries before it. My sister and I used to play MK64 and Double Dash together while we were growing up. Both she and my nephew were able to pick up a controller and start playing with ease. She was happy with the additions of the underwater portions, the zero-gravity gimmick and the addition of so many new items. We played for about five hours so far and had a blast. The bottom line is, if you're a Mario Kart fan, this game should not disappoint you. If you're a Wii U owner and looking for a fun game to play with your kids and/or family, this is an excellent choice as there is fun to be had by all with this game. Personally, I'm very happy with 8, although the few gripes I have with it keep it from being my favorite entry. It's nice to have a shiny new game to play on my Wii U, but as good as it is, I don't believe this is the system-seller that Nintendo was hoping for.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people.

Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry.

This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game. It is really cool to be able to race NPC's than compare your skills to real people."]}, {"Username":["K.

This game is awesome and epic all at the same time. The one thing I always like to point out that when Nintendo makes a game, they put their heart and soul into it. The graphics and music is amazing. The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games. In fact, I like how the customization of your kart and the track differences effect the outcome. Time flies when playing this game.

The graphics for this game are very well polished and the colors definitely grab your attention. This game feels almost exactly like Mario Kart 7, but it has it's perks compared to the 3DS Mario Kart. One being that there are bikes in this game, but better than the Wii Version because both types of vehicles are decently comparable in performance. In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels. I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors.

MK8 has 32 brilliant tracks that are so rich that they're hard to master completely.

And 150CC mode is hard enough that it will have you playing over and over trying to earn all of the gold trophies. Plus, every Grand Prix you finish opens up new characters and vehicle mods.

Despite the fact that I have far, far fewer friends in my life that are willing to play Mario Kart with me now than I did with the N64 game, I actually think this is a better Mario Kart than any that have come before. It outranks my hyperbolic memories of yesteryear. I just wish I had more people to play it with. If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1.

First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days. Follow that with the N64 version, which in my opinion, was one of the hugest leaps forward in arcade / party racing for its time. After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right. I wasn\u2019t able to change the button configuration\u2026 I would have been curious to see how it felt using a \u2018trigger\u2019 button as the gas instead of the \u2018A\u2019 button \u2013 but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race! It is very fun and I didn\u2019t have any bad experiences with people dropping out or doing other stupid things, which is what I have been pretty accustom to with other online gaming experiences I have tried. I didn\u2019t really notice any lagging issues, and I was using wireless internet. Very impressed! Let me finish by saying that I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Wii and was on the fence with the Wii U.

The transitions into flying, underwater, standard driving, and hovering are seamless, and flow perfectly! The level design is ingenious and is an absolute thrill! On most of the new courses there are many different paths, short cuts allowing for continuous exploration and variability. The retro courses too have been reworked a bit, keeping the same feel and theme but restructured a bit to maximize the use of the many abilities that the Mario Kart 8 Karts and bikes have, and instead of compromising the integrity of the classics, it simply redefines them while remaining true to the heritage. Also, on a side not, the instant replay is awesome! It is hilarious to slow the camera just as you get smacked with a turtle shell and watch the character's expressions! Overall great game!

He can vote for what map he wants to play, and its randomly selected so there's no Tyranny of the Majority going on (where a single map may get chosen indefinitely). There are a lot of variations of karts, gliders, wheels to unlock, as well as characters. I've heard rumors there may be DLC coming for the game as well - I don't know what it will consist of but I'm sure my son will be begging me to buy it, and I probably will. The replay value is very high, and if your kids have friends, they will all enjoy playing this game together.

Starkey"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I'll start off first by saying that the graphical leap is astounding. Sometimes I drive off the side of the course because I get stuck admiring the backgrounds and all the attention to detail. This game is gorgeous! Now that I've got that out of the way, I have quite a few criticisms of this game which I'd like to mention. First, I'm really disappointed with the character roster, despite having 29 characters (excluding your Mii) to choose from. I don't believe that the Koopalings are a very good addition to the game, at least not good enough to take up seven spaces when they could have brought back Bowser Jr and had space for six more characters. They should have brought back Birdo, Diddy Kong, Dry Bones, and King Boo. Maybe even included some characters like Dixie Kong and Kamek. Also, Metal Mario, Pink Gold Peach and Baby Rosalina seem a bit unnecessary to me. I'm holding out hope that some of these characters may be released later on through DLC. Secondly, the Battle mode feels stripped down compared to what it used to be. There are no more mode-specific arenas in which to compete and that feels like a step back for the series. Some people are claiming Battle mode has been ruined by this game. In my opinion, that's too harsh. It's not been ruined, but it just isn't as good as it once was. This can hopefully be remedied by a patch or DLC in the future as well. Now for the gameplay. There is a very minimal learning curve to this game as it plays almost the same as all entries before it. My sister and I used to play MK64 and Double Dash together while we were growing up. Both she and my nephew were able to pick up a controller and start playing with ease. She was happy with the additions of the underwater portions, the zero-gravity gimmick and the addition of so many new items. We played for about five hours so far and had a blast. The bottom line is, if you're a Mario Kart fan, this game should not disappoint you. If you're a Wii U owner and looking for a fun game to play with your kids and/or family, this is an excellent choice as there is fun to be had by all with this game. Personally, I'm very happy with 8, although the few gripes I have with it keep it from being my favorite entry. It's nice to have a shiny new game to play on my Wii U, but as good as it is, I don't believe this is the system-seller that Nintendo was hoping for.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people.

Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry.

This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game. It is really cool to be able to race NPC's than compare your skills to real people."]}, {"Username":["K.

This game is awesome and epic all at the same time. The one thing I always like to point out that when Nintendo makes a game, they put their heart and soul into it. The graphics and music is amazing. The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games. In fact, I like how the customization of your kart and the track differences effect the outcome. Time flies when playing this game.

The graphics for this game are very well polished and the colors definitely grab your attention. This game feels almost exactly like Mario Kart 7, but it has it's perks compared to the 3DS Mario Kart. One being that there are bikes in this game, but better than the Wii Version because both types of vehicles are decently comparable in performance. In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels. I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors.

Despite the fact that I have far, far fewer friends in my life that are willing to play Mario Kart with me now than I did with the N64 game, I actually think this is a better Mario Kart than any that have come before. It outranks my hyperbolic memories of yesteryear. I just wish I had more people to play it with. If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game.

First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before.

As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days. Follow that with the N64 version, which in my opinion, was one of the hugest leaps forward in arcade / party racing for its time. After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right. I wasn\u2019t able to change the button configuration\u2026 I would have been curious to see how it felt using a \u2018trigger\u2019 button as the gas instead of the \u2018A\u2019 button \u2013 but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race! It is very fun and I didn\u2019t have any bad experiences with people dropping out or doing other stupid things, which is what I have been pretty accustom to with other online gaming experiences I have tried. I didn\u2019t really notice any lagging issues, and I was using wireless internet. Very impressed! Let me finish by saying that I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Wii and was on the fence with the Wii U.

The transitions into flying, underwater, standard driving, and hovering are seamless, and flow perfectly! The level design is ingenious and is an absolute thrill! On most of the new courses there are many different paths, short cuts allowing for continuous exploration and variability. The retro courses too have been reworked a bit, keeping the same feel and theme but restructured a bit to maximize the use of the many abilities that the Mario Kart 8 Karts and bikes have, and instead of compromising the integrity of the classics, it simply redefines them while remaining true to the heritage. Also, on a side not, the instant replay is awesome! It is hilarious to slow the camera just as you get smacked with a turtle shell and watch the character's expressions! Overall great game!

It's a lot of fun and the online racing helps build some competitive nature in my son. Whenever I'm unable to play the game with him, and he's tired of beating up on the computers, it helps that he can go online to play against other people. He can vote for what map he wants to play, and its randomly selected so there's no Tyranny of the Majority going on (where a single map may get chosen indefinitely). There are a lot of variations of karts, gliders, wheels to unlock, as well as characters. I've heard rumors there may be DLC coming for the game as well - I don't know what it will consist of but I'm sure my son will be begging me to buy it, and I probably will. The replay value is very high, and if your kids have friends, they will all enjoy playing this game together.

Starkey"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I'll start off first by saying that the graphical leap is astounding. Sometimes I drive off the side of the course because I get stuck admiring the backgrounds and all the attention to detail. This game is gorgeous! Now that I've got that out of the way, I have quite a few criticisms of this game which I'd like to mention. First, I'm really disappointed with the character roster, despite having 29 characters (excluding your Mii) to choose from. I don't believe that the Koopalings are a very good addition to the game, at least not good enough to take up seven spaces when they could have brought back Bowser Jr and had space for six more characters. They should have brought back Birdo, Diddy Kong, Dry Bones, and King Boo. Maybe even included some characters like Dixie Kong and Kamek. Also, Metal Mario, Pink Gold Peach and Baby Rosalina seem a bit unnecessary to me. I'm holding out hope that some of these characters may be released later on through DLC. Secondly, the Battle mode feels stripped down compared to what it used to be. There are no more mode-specific arenas in which to compete and that feels like a step back for the series. Some people are claiming Battle mode has been ruined by this game. In my opinion, that's too harsh. It's not been ruined, but it just isn't as good as it once was. This can hopefully be remedied by a patch or DLC in the future as well. Now for the gameplay. There is a very minimal learning curve to this game as it plays almost the same as all entries before it. My sister and I used to play MK64 and Double Dash together while we were growing up. Both she and my nephew were able to pick up a controller and start playing with ease. She was happy with the additions of the underwater portions, the zero-gravity gimmick and the addition of so many new items. We played for about five hours so far and had a blast. The bottom line is, if you're a Mario Kart fan, this game should not disappoint you. If you're a Wii U owner and looking for a fun game to play with your kids and/or family, this is an excellent choice as there is fun to be had by all with this game. Personally, I'm very happy with 8, although the few gripes I have with it keep it from being my favorite entry. It's nice to have a shiny new game to play on my Wii U, but as good as it is, I don't believe this is the system-seller that Nintendo was hoping for.

It is Mario Kart. If you love Mario Kart, you will love this game. If you hate Mario Kart, you will continue to hate this one. The formula is tampered with very very little. Sure there are a couple new items, and the hover parts of the track are nifty, but at it's core it is the same as every other MK game. I don't mean that to sound over critical, the MK formula is like the formula for Coke; don't screw with it. But maaaybe a little more freshness would have been nice. Also, while the core game is there, and there are lots of unlocks, and a goodly amount of tracks...it's pretty straightforward. Not much to do here besides run the actual races, either online or solo. The replay stuff is mild fun, and the slow mo function is sure to elicit lots of malicious giggles at your most vicious take-downs. But given the viral popularity of the \"luigi death stare\" and clips of mad racing exploits, I think Nintendo missed a golden opportunity to add a really fleshed out replay editor and sharing community. I know they don't like to add highly technical \"do it yourself\" kind of things to their games, because they envision their products as toys not tech. But this is also a generation of kids growing up playing Minecraft, I'm pretty sure they could handle it and build a community around it. Also given the amount of awesome side stuff they pack into Smash Bros. titles, a little extra lovin in Mario Kart would have felt appropriate. Lastly, for those uninitiated to Mario Kart, I will offer this warning. You may think you are a good person. You may think you could never say an unpleasant word to your TV screen. You may think you would never wish a fiery painful death on 11 other random people.

Kelso"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["To give my perspective on Mario Kart, I'll say that I spent countless blissful hours of my youth duking it out on the tracks of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 with my friends and family, as well as whittling down my fastest Time Trials records on my favorite tracks. For me, MK64 very narrowly takes the crown as best in the series. With Mario Kart 8, that crown is in jeopardy. Whilst I enjoyed the GBA and DS entries (and secretly yearned for a Virtual Boy installment... yes, I had one of those), the handheld versions lacked the spark for me. For that reason, and feeling like I'd outgrown handheld gaming, I never played MK7 on the 3DS. I Never owned a Wii either, and what little of Mario Kart Wii I played, I could not stand it for the ridiculous AI rubber-banding. Double-Dash on the 'Cube was very good, with some brilliant tracks, gorgeous graphics for the time, and lots of interesting new gameplay elements, but didn't have the \"it factor\" of the first two games in the series. It also seemed like the flash point for the fun-and-soul-sucking cheap AI tricks. Enter Mario Kart 8. Right away I felt overwhelmingly positive about the game. The gameplay seemed to return to the series roots, where racing is the focus, skills prevail, and items add to the fun and chaos of the race, they don't define it (more often than not). And I couldn't stop smiling. And I still can't stop smiling as I rack up more hours with this game. You can't help it; this is a game that just nails almost every detail. I'm so happy to have coins back; they add an interesting gameplay element and should never have disappeared. The air, water, and anti-gravity sequences add variety to the tracks but work seamlessly and do not mess with the pace or feel of the game. I guess the air/gliding parts alter the handling characteristics a lot and they aren't my favorite, but they aren't over used. The stupid rubber-banding is mostly gone and should never return. Mario Kart 8 plays so much better for it. Item balance is much improved, with fewer catastrophic chains of punishment when you are in or near the front of the pack. Fewer blue shells and the super horn for defense only improve the game. Honestly, I wouldn't shed a tear if they eventually removed the blue shell entirely, it really only serves to frustrate without really helping the player that uses it. I have no problem with the race leader getting an abundance of coin items (and the fact that you can't carry an extra item) because those in the front of the pack shouldn't just always have a get out of jail free card or two in hand. It's obvious to anyone, but the graphics are phenomenal in every way. It would have been great if MK8 ran in full 1080p instead of upscaling 720p or had at least some type of anti-aliasing to smooth out jagged pixels, but this is the most minor of complaints. This game proves that the Wii U has plenty of horsepower for high-definition graphics. Maybe not on the same level as the PS4 or XBONE, but those consoles are still weaker than a mid-range PC of two years ago, so if this is what you care about then you're looking in the wrong place. Talent and art direction trumps raw power. The music and sound is the best I've ever heard from a video game. The live bands, the surround sound, the tunes, it's awesome. Online multiplayer is good. It could be better, but I'll still spend a ton of time with it. It plays very smooth and lag free, it feels like playing offline. I've had a few times where I was hit by some unknown item where I had no indication of what it was, which hasn't happened while offline. There needs to be rankings, leaderboards, and such. This is an unfortunate omission, even if tournaments somewhat have it. There needs to be more interaction with other players and friend list integration. Not during races though, I'm fine without it. That's what local multiplayer and couches are for. I always get a lot of mileage out of Time Trials and am happy with how they work in MK8. There is good ghost integration and I like how you can see where your best run lands on the bell curve. That's cool. I've seen a lot of e-tears out there regarding Battle Mode, but I don't really care about it. I played a TON of battle mode in SMK and MK64, but to me the concept has grown tired could be completely replaced by some other new mode. I understand some people still like it and I wish they would have at least included some remakes of the best classic battle mode courses like Block Fort, but I'm over it. The kart/bike customization thing doesn't do too much for me. I wish you could see character base stats when choosing them and I wish it were easier to see and compare the stats of all the different components. It doesn't seem to add so much to the game when so many components have the same stats, too. It also seems to me like the impact of your character choice, kart customization, and handling/traction stats don't translate really well to how your setup actually feels on the track. I'm still a little confused there. I guess I just want to find my favorite setup then spend my time perfecting it on the track. All the choices just are just superfluous to me. All the controller choices on the Wii U are a little absurd if you ask me, it just serves to confuse people and make us spend more money. That said, by far my favorite option for MK8 is the Wii U Pro Controller. It feels perfect. The gamepad doesn't fit my hands well for this game and doesn't add enough features to fully take advantage of it. The fact that you can't do local multiplayer with one person on the gamepad screen and another on the TV is just... I don't know what to say. I hope they had a good reason for it. I like setting up the gamepad with the map that I can glance to, but sometimes miss having it on screen, and it's pretty lame to not have it at all when another player is using the gamepad. So Mario Kart 8 is starting to feel like my new favorite in the series, which for me says a lot. We'll see how I feel when the newness fully wears off, but I like its chances. This game is not without its faults, but I feel overwhelmingly positive about it. None of the faults are individually or all-together worth docking it a star. Just buy the game. If you don't have a Wii U and you are still reading this, go buy the MK8 bundle right now. You won't be sorry. Unless you are the human incarnation of the fun-and-soul-sucking blue shell, in which case, consider yourself super-horned."]}, {"Username":["Mr. Freeze"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["First I want to establish that I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, I did not purchase this on Amazon. This game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of charm, the visuals are great, and the gameplay is fantastic. What I thought was really unique were the visuals that Mario Kart 8 used. It seems that Nintendo was heavily influenced by F-Zero, specifically, F-Zero GX. By this I mean the cool visual tricks used during gameplay. The tracks are not always on flat ground, many of the tracks have the racers go up (or down) vertical walls, race upside-down, and race underwater. It is a really cool visual treat, and it really reminds me of F-Zero GX. I want to give kudos to Nintendo for using a great racing game as an influence. In addition to the visuals, I really liked the gameplay. I grew up with Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, so I know what old Mario Kart games feel like; I mention this because I was disappointed with Mario Kart Wii. However, I felt this game really focused more on the 'kart' racing and less on silly gimmicks. I also love the online play and how easy it is to jump in and out of a game.

This game is awesome and epic all at the same time. The one thing I always like to point out that when Nintendo makes a game, they put their heart and soul into it. The graphics and music is amazing. The crisp pictures really put you in the game. So much attention to detail is in the game, like you notice the characters hair flying in the wind. The game is easy to pick up and play with little learning curve. That is what I didn't like about Mario Kart Wii; the controls were not so simple. It took a while to get used to the turning. However, on this installment you don't have that problem. It is the perfect mix between the Wii and 3ds games. In fact, I like how the customization of your kart and the track differences effect the outcome. Time flies when playing this game.

The graphics for this game are very well polished and the colors definitely grab your attention. This game feels almost exactly like Mario Kart 7, but it has it's perks compared to the 3DS Mario Kart. One being that there are bikes in this game, but better than the Wii Version because both types of vehicles are decently comparable in performance. In my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of the new levels. I don't think the anti-gravity is utilized enough, but I'm sure over time that the new maps will grow on me, just like all of the Mario Kart 8 predecessors.

And 150CC mode is hard enough that it will have you playing over and over trying to earn all of the gold trophies. Plus, every Grand Prix you finish opens up new characters and vehicle mods.

It outranks my hyperbolic memories of yesteryear. I just wish I had more people to play it with. If you're a Mario Kart fan, or have ever been one, you're going to love this game."]}, {"Username":["Isabelle Belzile"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I picked this up on launch day, even before seeing the reviews, on the basis that the Mario Kart Wii had been the most solid $$ I'd spent on a video game in years. The graphics are amped up into HD of course, and are much more crisp than the Wii version. The sound effects and music are also greatly enhanced, with full orchestral music in various styles throughout the game. The game also fully renders at 60 frames per second, solid, in both single and two-player mode. Three and four player drop to 30 frames per second, but the game plays solid at all times, with no frame drops or slow downs. Enhancing the \"Instant Replay\" of previous versions is a \"Highlight Reel\" function that allows YouTube upload and slow motion replay STILL at 60 frames per second. It must be seen to be believed. The online multiplayer mode is similarly butter smooth, even playing against worldwide opponents, with no visible stutter or lag, and a skill-based match-making system similar to Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 is, without a doubt, the highest production value yet seen from Big N. It's not just new shiny though. Gameplay is also greatly enhanced, adding flight, underwater driving and anti-gravity. The item mix and AI have also been re-balanced to reward driving skill, compared to the Wii predecessor. Winning is now more a matter of skill, as opposed to lucky item pickups. The process of unlocking content has also been greatly simplified, without all the tedious unlock-grinding the Wii version required. This ease of unlocking is offset by the sheer volume of unlockable content, as there are 30 playable characters and a much wider variety of karts than the Wii version. Similar to the last several entries in the series, the game includes numerous \"Retro\" tracks from previous Mario Kart titles. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 does a better job of incorporating the new game mechanics into these classic courses. Every controller that is compatible with the Wii U is usable, in any combination in multiplayer games, using either tilt or button based control. It's not quite all rainbows and unicorns; there are a few warts. After each race, the menu defaults to the highlight reel, rather than the more obvious \"next race\" option. While there are 30 playable characters, five of them are babies, two are palette swaps, and all seven Koopalings are present. Members of the Donkey Kong clan are notably under-represented, with only Donkey Kong making the cut. Many of the Karts and tires are similar, with many unlockables being obvious palette or sprite-swaps of existing items. The YouTube feature, while cool, takes forever to get started, and the upload cannot proceed in the background while you continue racing; you are forced to wait until the upload is complete. These are minor quibbles though in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this game is a worthy successor to the Mario Kart throne, and easily the best entry in the series in at least a decade. Not to denigrate the previous entries, which were excellent, this game is just that good. If you've been on the fence about getting the Wii U system, this might just be the nudge you need to pull the trigger."]}, {"Username":["Waterlgndx"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["So far I think this game is amazing. The graphics are incredible, the speed while racing seems to be faster than most of the previous titles (except for Mario Kart 64). Grand Prix's seem to speed by and the game is a bit of a mind warp. The old courses have been carefully preserved (except for N64 Rainbow Road) implementing a little bit of new elements to pre Mario Kart 7 games. I haven't noticed too many differences between MK7 courses in MK8 and MK7 however I admit that I haven't played Mario Kart 7 nearly as much as the other console titles. Grumble Volcano has had rough edges added to it (I can't say whether this adds to the difficulty level or not yet it feels restrictive and somewhat annoying). Some of the courses seem to lack new elements presented from this game. I'm not really disappointed by this though because it seems to conserve the original experiences of the courses. N64 Rainbow Road I feel did not preserve the original feeling to it because instead of doing 3 laps you do 3 sections (making 1 full lap). This shortens the length of the race but it also cuts into the experience. The magic of Rainbow Road just seems to be sucked out by the changes made with the course layout. The chain chomps instead of trying to eat you simply roll around creating waves. On the plus side I felt like the visual displays during the race were great, the fireworks seemed to translate well, the train, etc. When I played the N64 version I felt like I was visiting different parts of Mario history, it felt like a tour and journey--I didn't get the same feeling here nor did I get a similar feeling like I was revisiting the race from N64. On the other hand, SNES Donut Plains 3 was incredible. I realize this track changed slightly for the Wii U but it also felt like it was some number of years later and these were the changes that happened over that time period. Part of the bridge was missing now and parts of the course have a thin layer of water on top of them giving the feeling that it's been abandoned. I realize this was a personal experience I had with the game so this might not translate the same way for everyone. My disappointments may be another's treasure and vice-versa. I just thought it would be good to share those experiences because this game, for me, did provoke emotions simply from a track layout and presentation. I think items have been rebalanced for the faster pace in this game. Falling down is not quite as detrimental as it is in previous titles, you're nearly immediately placed back on track, the cost is 3 coins if you have them. If I had to sum it up I think I would call it Mario Kart F-Zero style. It's like a smoother version of Mario Kart 7, the transition between different modes of play is instantaneous and has a natural feel to it. The courses themselves have an F-Zero style to them the game play is definitely Mario Kart. The game is much more forgiving in most cases (hitting a wall the wrong way isn't quite as harsh as it might be in other titles) and infact sometimes when you hit a wall you are simply redirected causing a very small penalty in time. Kart selection is Mario Kart 7 style. I don't know how important players' weight classes are it seems to have some amount of impact on the overall kart + player weight. Each selection (kart, tires, and glider) has an impact on the stats (weight, speed, acceleration, handling, and traction). I think there use to be a gliding stat in Mario Kart 7 and I'm not sure how these stats factor into the older style stats. I am under the impression that this game will be given additional content by DLC but I'm not sure how that will work. I don't think there's anything official stating that is something that is going to occur nor am I sure what kind of content will be offered. If I had to guess character selection might need a boost. There are some racers not present in this title currently that I would've expected to see. I'm not sure why but I found myself somewhat disappointed by the lack of day and night in this game. It might've given the game some variety if day and night were implemented in a way that was appropriate (like every 1 hr in real life = 1 day in Mario Kart 8). Please note that this does not impact my scoring for the game in any way. I should mention this when doing 2 player the split screen is vertical instead of horizontal, so the screen is split into left and right sections instead of top and bottom. I feel like this was an appropriate choice given the nature of courses in this game. The atmosphere is important in the feel this game gives you when you play. Another nice thing is that you can do multiplayer grand prix!! Yes that means you can have 2-4 players and still do grand prix! Interface: what's different? There's no on tv display of the map, other players positions, etc, this is on the Gamepad. That would be nice except there's not really anyway that I've found that lets you look at that information easily during game play, I'm pretty sure if you pause it something covers up the display. It would be nice if we had the option to place this on the tv somewhere non obtrusive. I'm not sure how much this detracts from the experience of the game though it's different but how much does it really hurt? Not a whole lot. It'd be too harsh to knock a star off for this design choice in the interface. Another thing worth mentioning is the load time is noticable on this game. I can't remember what the load time is like on Wii but I feel like the load time on Wii U is significant. Note that I have the physical copy of the game. I'm very curious if the digital copy is faster. Sometime I hope to try to time it and get some sort of casually observed average, or perhaps record it and get a more accurate loading time. I'm not sure if the loading time just seems longer because the courses are shorter, or if the loading time actually is longer. Online: I haven't played online as much, but basically you can have 2 players play online. They are able to use an account on Wii U to play. The host will continue their progress with rating which starts at 1000 and depending on performance during a race with your peers goes up or down. The guest will start at 1000 points and will progress during the session. After the session is over the guest loses any progress while the host keeps their points. (Perhaps if the guest has a Mario Kart 8 file this behavior changes or something but this isn't something I tested or researched.) Your friends are system-wide in Wii U so you don't have to re-register your friends for this game which is incredibly nice. Overall: I think Mario Kart 8 will rank highly in comparison to other Mario Kart games and as of now I would say that it's my second favorite--second to Mario Kart 64. I've given it 4 stars in fear that the replay value will not be as great as other titles. I'm concerned that I will get sick of it earlier than other games. I plan on coming back and updating in 6 months to decide between keeping it at 4 stars or granting it its 5th star. Overall as of this writing I'd give this game a 9.2/10. Played: Single Player: Grand Prix; Multiplayer: Grand Prix, Versus; 2-Player Online on my brothers Wii U (I was the guest) Not Played: Battle Mode, Time Trials, MKTV. Progress: Mirror mode unlocked, all characters seem to be unlocked. 3 star in all 50cc cups, all gold in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. Gold in Mirror: Mushroom and Banana Cup. Pros: pace, graphics, gameplay, course layouts, item rebalancing, coin mechanics, multiplayer grand prix is back (and now supports 2-4 players instead of just 2)!, you can progress in the game by doing versus mode (can still collect coins!) Cons: danger of losing replay value over time, difficulty level seems a bit less due to the forgiving nature of this game, on-screen information, loading time"]}, {"Username":["James Morales"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Before MK8 my favorite game in the series was Double Dash for the Gamecube. I've owned MK for the DS and the 3DS and, sure, the online was great, but for me the most important thing is just having a bunch of friends over having fun playing this game. The graphics are crisp, the controls are tight, and the track selection is impressive. The anti-gravity adds a small twist to each stage and the Super Horn (which can destroy oncoming Blue Shells) is a great addition. The computer also seems smarter in this game, so don't expect easy wins in 150cc Grand Prix mode! What really made this a sweet deal was that I was also able to get The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD for free just by purchasing this game! As much as I love this game, however, there's a few flaws I have to mention. Racing with the Wiimote is awkward and different than using a regular kind of controller. The Wiimote+Nunchuk combinaton isn't as bad but I would still prefer to use a normal-type controller (Nintendo sells a \"Pro Controller for the Wii U, but one of these will cost you about $40 on Amazon.) My hope is that Nintendo's newly announced Gamecube Controller adapter for the Wii U works with MK8. The track selection in MK8 also disappointed me because I felt as thought it was missing some of my favorite maps (but Nintendo can always decide to release more retro maps through DLC). The Battle mode in this game also disappointed me; instead of playing in different small maps/area designed for battle mode, you have to play on the actual racing tracks like Rainbow Road or Mario Circuit. Overall, if you're on the edge about this game, the free Nintendo game that comes with it should really help seal the deal (but don't wait on it because the deal ends July 31st!). Mario Kart 8 might not be perfect right now, but with a couple updates and DLC it should be a 10/10 game."]}, {"Username":["Lilfurbal"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This game is really good, I would give it 5 stars but that implies to me that it is perfect. It is not perfect, so it gets 4 stars. To start off, right away, here's why it loses a star: -There's no minimap on the screen during races or battle mode. You apparently have to use the gamepad screen for the minimap, which is pointless if you're not playing using the gamepad or unfair in local multiplayer if only one person gets to use the gamepad. Also by removing your eyes from the road to look down at the gamepack can often result in disaster. So, what the heck, I want an onscreen minimap as is tradition. -The N64 Rainbow Road retro track has been ruined. I was so pumped up for the return of this epic track, only now it's not so epic. Somehow they turned it from being the longest track in the series to easily the shortest track in this entire game. The track has great music, and comes off looking epic with all the flashy stuff and fireworks, but it's really over in like a minute. Sucks if you got off to a rough start because there's not much time to make up for that. The reasoning for this track being ruined is that you only do one lap around now, one full lap, split into 3 sections. Seeing as to how it was so long on the N64 version that you only did 2 laps, you're still only doing half the race. The track is still shorter because you're now going through it faster. I now want them to fix this track to be how it should have been, one of my favorite tracks has been made to be a huge disappointment. -And to be nitpicky - would be nice to have the mii character not wearing the helmets. Also they removed characters from previous mario karts to make room for a slew of koopalings. Fortunately that's all I have to say about the bad stuff. The game itself is made to be appropriately challenging, all the new tracks have been very well designed and are fun. Basically if you've ever liked mario kart before, you'll continue to like it now. It's not much different. Blue shells appear to be more rare now, however there's also an item that can be used to prevent getting hit by a blue shell. The squid ink is possibly annoyingly more effective now. Battle mode probably should have had some traditional battle arenas put in, although I personally enjoy the regular tracks also. Particularly Yoshi's Valley, it's a really cool battleground. However the lack of on screen minimaps contributes to difficulties of tracking people down. Online mode is lots of fun, and considering they have since turned off online play for previous mario kart games, gotta upgrade to this game to continue enjoying online mode. There is also tournaments online now, and you can gather coins to unlock new karts and accessories while playing online. I've also noticed that the penalty of getting 12th place during online matches is much less severe than on the wii, where you could lose hours of progress for your online score from one botched race. It ultimately doesn't matter much in the end, but no one likes losing 100+ points."]}, {"Username":["The Youngs \"theyoungs07\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Like most people have said, the game is great...but they messed up the battle mode. The game is easy to pick up and play, if you've played a previous version of Mario Kart then it'll be straight-forward. I love that they have taken tracks from previous game versions and added some new dimensions to them. I have grown to like using the WiiMote and a nunchuck, the motion controls just don't work for me. The music is fantastic, they updated some of the old songs from the previous games so some of them bring back great memories. The graphics are top-notch. I love the creativity they put into the tracks. If I had the time, I'd probably race through the tracks slowly just to see all that is going on around me. I'm so focused on the road that I see flashes of cool stuff in the background but I'd love to really take the time to check it all out. The weapons are great, but I did notice that when I'm in first-->third I only seem to get coins or green shells, but the CPU players that are right behind me nail me with red shells often...kind of frustrating. I have yet to see the real value of the coins, but that's probably because I just picked up and played. When the Lakitu has to save you from a pit...etc, you lose 3 coins. The flying feature is new to me, there are times that you are launched in the air and you don't just get flung like in the Wii/Cube/N64 versions, now you have a glider that you can control...and it matters! You can get a real advantage if you learn to control your flight. It'll also give you an opportunity to get to some alternative routes on tracks. The anti-gravity feature basically means you can race on roller-coaster tracks. It is really fun, but it doesn't change the physics of racing, so while it looks cool it doesn't change the way you race other than alternate routes. This game is highly customizable, you can change the items available, the level of the CPUs, random tracks, this means you can tailor it to how you want to play. Multi-player racing is great, I really enjoy team mode or racing against each other. This is pretty standard if you've played previous versions. My son and I tried battle because we had grown to love it on the other consoles. First we tried Team Battle...I don't remember that option in previous version. Then the track selection screen...WHERE ARE THE BATTLE ARENAS!! MK8 only allows you to play on actual tracks, with 12 battlers going at a time. We spent 5 minutes looking for people to only see them blur by before being able to do real damage, the track was too tight to turn around and pursue easily. I do not like this change and only hope that Nintendo will release some battle arenas in an update, heck I'd pay for them in DLC. Another thing that irks me (I really hope I'm just missing this somewhere) is the availability of a map on the screen to show where everyone is on the track. The person using the gamepad gets one, but no one else does...that can be a heck of an advantage. They'd have to fix that if they fix battle as well. I used to love battle so much that I almost gave the game 3 stars instead of 4. At least there is a ton of redeeming qualities about this game. I'm sure we'll be playing it a lot as a family, now if only they'd give us some proper battle arenas."]}, {"Username":["Jose.Ruiz"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Don't listen to any of the 1 star reviews, all of them are people that are just scared the Wii U succeeding with this amazing game and can come up with a reasonable excuse to give it a 1. One of the reviews said that you can't go shopping and turtle shells represent animal abuse...But anyway, this is definitely the best mario kart game to date. First lets start with what's most important ,the tracks. Almost Every single track has been designed to showcase the Wii U's powers and incorporate it's new mechanic, anti gravity. The tracks are all amazingly well done and there's not a boring one among them, even the retro tracks all feel brand new due to alterations to include underwater or anti gravity. The items are well balanced and rely more on skill than just luck, basically this game is made for true mario kart fans because the AI is brutal, they take shortcuts and save their weapons for when they're about to get hit or you're right behind them. The soundtrack is live orchestrated, the first for a mario kart game and it's probably my favorite soundtrack behind mario kart 64. And the graphics....Jesus Lordy the graphics are probably the best I've seen this generation, there is an extremely anmount of detail in this game, even on the tracks you can see your tire tracks, gravel on the road, lighting, particle effects. Everything about this game is just beautiful. My only complaint is battle mode, instead of arenas you get regular tracks, I never play battle mode so I don't really care but it just feels like a downgrade from before. Regardless I can't find a single wrong thing with mario kart 8, Nintendo set out to make a show stopper to show everyone the wii u's powers, and this is just a start. A MUST HAVE."]}, {"Username":["Jake Alexander"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["Mario Kart has been around for 20 years and although the previous additions were amazing games, this one beats them all. With its 30 characters, wonderful graphics, level design, and racing fun, you can't go wrong. Mario Kart 8 has all the modes that Mario Kart 7 had. Unfortunately, Mario Kart 8's Battle Mode is a huge problem using normal race tracks. It is to hard to find someone and when you do, they might as well kill you with a green shell. The new items work great. In conclusion, Mario Kart 8 is an amazing game, and I recommend it to any Wii U owner. Or if you don't have a Wii U, buy one."]}, {"Username":["Ather Masood"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This weekend has been reserved for Mario Kart 8 and nothing else!

Onwards to Smash Bros and Zelda!!"]}, {"Username":["Nutwiisystem.Com"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["It's no secret that the Wii U has been struggling. Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that. There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk). The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel. The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time. Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks. Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession). They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters. Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform. There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos. You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players. One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other. They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online. Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board. While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't."]}, {"Username":["Dr-Cog"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Let me start by saying that I have been a Mario Kart fan for a long time\u2026 I\u2019m talking since the Super Nintendo days. Follow that with the N64 version, which in my opinion, was one of the hugest leaps forward in arcade / party racing for its time. After that, the other Mario Kart games didn\u2019t really peak my interest that much\u2026\u2026 UNTIL NOW! In Mario Kart 8, the steering is EXCELLENT! It doesn\u2019t feel too loose or too tight. The power sliding is spot on! There are even times you are GLIDING THROUGH THE AIR on huge jumps and spinning around the track in some sort of GRAVITY / HOVER MODE! All the mechanics of everything just feel right. I wasn\u2019t able to change the button configuration\u2026 I would have been curious to see how it felt using a \u2018trigger\u2019 button as the gas instead of the \u2018A\u2019 button \u2013 but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. The race track design is OUTSTANDING! All of the tracks are varied and pretty unique in their own way. There are tropical tracks, ice tracks, farm tracks, lava tracks, and the list goes on. There are even a few spots where you are underwater, or flying through the air on MONSTER jumps\u2026 I am in video game nostalgia with a few of the classic N64 like tracks, which have been graphically re-mastered, modified, and enhanced to perfection!!!! The graphics are AMAZING and the frame rate is extremely SMOOTH! This is coming from someone who has recently been playing higher end PS3 titles. The textures in this are great, and the characters are impressive. There are lots of nice colors everywhere, but its not too overwhelming. In addition, there are a lot of extra things happening in the background and in my peripheral vision that add to the overall beauty of these environments. I am NOT a fan of ONLINE GAMING\u2026 But this is DIFFERENT. I was HOOKED. I just clicked on the online game play, and was put into the next available race! It is very fun and I didn\u2019t have any bad experiences with people dropping out or doing other stupid things, which is what I have been pretty accustom to with other online gaming experiences I have tried. I didn\u2019t really notice any lagging issues, and I was using wireless internet. Very impressed! Let me finish by saying that I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Wii and was on the fence with the Wii U. This is one of the titles that swayed my decision to buy it - and I have no regrets!"]}, {"Username":["Hawke525"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["Beautiful graphics, gameplay is awesome, much more balanced. Music is also huge plus. Another praise I'll give is the online experience. Connecting is much quicker and during races, it was smooth. It does feel different so you'll have to get use to it for a bit. But once you do. You'll want to play this over MK Wii. Another complaint is that there's too many baby characters and koopas imo.

The transitions into flying, underwater, standard driving, and hovering are seamless, and flow perfectly! The level design is ingenious and is an absolute thrill! On most of the new courses there are many different paths, short cuts allowing for continuous exploration and variability. The retro courses too have been reworked a bit, keeping the same feel and theme but restructured a bit to maximize the use of the many abilities that the Mario Kart 8 Karts and bikes have, and instead of compromising the integrity of the classics, it simply redefines them while remaining true to the heritage. Also, on a side not, the instant replay is awesome! It is hilarious to slow the camera just as you get smacked with a turtle shell and watch the character's expressions! Overall great game!

Mario Kart has always delivered to this end. But the latest installment is especially satisfying for a few reasons: ? Graphics. Finally, a truly pretty Mario Kart game. The series gets a much needed graphical upgrade courtesy of the Wii U. ? Characters. 30 of them. Enough said. ? Unlockables. You have to unlock 14 of the 30 characters. You have to unlock most of the tracks. You get to unlock karts... and tires... and parasails. It really gives you more reason to play and a greater sense of accomplishment. A couple of minor negatives: ? No coin runners. They kept balloon battle, which isn't as fun as coin runners in my opinion. Oh well, guess it's all about the racing! ? If you are used to playing Mario Kart with little kids, you have grown fond of the 12th place rule where the race will automatically end after 11th place finishes.

It arrived and suddenly I'm the best mom and wife in the history of ever! After playing it myself, I'm kind of partial to me, too. ;) We've purchased many \"Mario Kart\" games over the years and I was wondering if this one wouldn't just be a newer version, slightly different, but pretty much the same as the others. I was happily wrong. The principle is the same, but there are so many new features and options... and the courses are so fun!! My 8 yr old loves that you can customize your kart. If you enjoy previous versions of Mario Kart or if you're new to this type of game, I'd sure recommend getting it. You won't be disappointed. Also, because it's hard to find games that kiddos can play, I'll let you know that my barely 5 year old daughter can play this along with the family. Granted, she's not going to come in first place, but she's not in last either. (Though my 8yr old sweetly holds off the computer-players so her sister can win every now and then.)

Whitecotton"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["My 5 yr old son loves to play this game. Okay, I love to play it too! It's a lot of fun and the online racing helps build some competitive nature in my son. Whenever I'm unable to play the game with him, and he's tired of beating up on the computers, it helps that he can go online to play against other people. He can vote for what map he wants to play, and its randomly selected so there's no Tyranny of the Majority going on (where a single map may get chosen indefinitely). There are a lot of variations of karts, gliders, wheels to unlock, as well as characters. I've heard rumors there may be DLC coming for the game as well - I don't know what it will consist of but I'm sure my son will be begging me to buy it, and I probably will. The replay value is very high, and if your kids have friends, they will all enjoy playing this game together. I wish they had a breakdown of how each kart/wheel/glider affects the handling, top speed, and acceleration, but I guess Nintendo just wanted to make it very simple for everyone to play without over thinking how the combination you use will actually affect the game play."]}, {"Username":["Jonathan T. Starkey"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I'll start off first by saying that the graphical leap is astounding. Sometimes I drive off the side of the course because I get stuck admiring the backgrounds and all the attention to detail. This game is gorgeous! Now that I've got that out of the way, I have quite a few criticisms of this game which I'd like to mention. First, I'm really disappointed with the character roster, despite having 29 characters (excluding your Mii) to choose from. I don't believe that the Koopalings are a very good addition to the game, at least not good enough to take up seven spaces when they could have brought back Bowser Jr and had space for six more characters. They should have brought back Birdo, Diddy Kong, Dry Bones, and King Boo. Maybe even included some characters like Dixie Kong and Kamek. Also, Metal Mario, Pink Gold Peach and Baby Rosalina seem a bit unnecessary to me. I'm holding out hope that some of these characters may be released later on through DLC. Secondly, the Battle mode feels stripped down compared to what it used to be. There are no more mode-specific arenas in which to compete and that feels like a step back for the series. Some people are claiming Battle mode has been ruined by this game. In my opinion, that's too harsh. It's not been ruined, but it just isn't as good as it once was. This can hopefully be remedied by a patch or DLC in the future as well. Now for the gameplay. There is a very minimal learning curve to this game as it plays almost the same as all entries before it. My sister and I used to play MK64 and Double Dash together while we were growing up. Both she and my nephew were able to pick up a controller and start playing with ease. She was happy with the additions of the underwater portions, the zero-gravity gimmick and the addition of so many new items. We played for about five hours so far and had a blast. The bottom line is, if you're a Mario Kart fan, this game should not disappoint you. If you're a Wii U owner and looking for a fun game to play with your kids and/or family, this is an excellent choice as there is fun to be had by all with this game. Personally, I'm very happy with 8, although the few gripes I have with it keep it from being my favorite entry. It's nice to have a shiny new game to play on my Wii U, but as good as it is, I don't believe this is the system-seller that Nintendo was hoping for.
