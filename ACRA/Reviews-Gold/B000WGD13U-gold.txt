With no clip this pen has no sharp edges to damage the other contents of my pockets, which is nice, but it rolls off tables readily. I am neutral on the appearance of this pen; while it is clearly well made, most people I hand it too don't know right away how to use it and several people have commented that it looks a bit like a suppository. While this pen always writes immediately, every once in a while it will leak a small glob of ink onto the page just when I start writing with it. As for writing quality, I have a Zebra F-701 which writes a very clean and fine line which I prefer to the space pen. For pocket use this pen is king and I highly recommend it.

[{"Username":["J. Kent"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I got one of these as a gift 8 months ago and immediately used it everyday afterward. The length is perfect to fit into a pocket, while still being full length with the cap off. Being made almost entirely of metal it has a very satisfying weight in the hands. With no clip this pen has no sharp edges to damage the other contents of my pockets, which is nice, but it rolls off tables readily. I am neutral on the appearance of this pen; while it is clearly well made, most people I hand it too don't know right away how to use it and several people have commented that it looks a bit like a suppository. While this pen always writes immediately, every once in a while it will leak a small glob of ink onto the page just when I start writing with it. As for writing quality, I have a Zebra F-701 which writes a very clean and fine line which I prefer to the space pen. For pocket use this pen is king and I highly recommend it.

[{"Username":["J. Kent"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I got one of these as a gift 8 months ago and immediately used it everyday afterward. The length is perfect to fit into a pocket, while still being full length with the cap off. Being made almost entirely of metal it has a very satisfying weight in the hands. With no clip this pen has no sharp edges to damage the other contents of my pockets, which is nice, but it rolls off tables readily. I am neutral on the appearance of this pen; while it is clearly well made, most people I hand it too don't know right away how to use it and several people have commented that it looks a bit like a suppository. While this pen always writes immediately, every once in a while it will leak a small glob of ink onto the page just when I start writing with it. As for writing quality, I have a Zebra F-701 which writes a very clean and fine line which I prefer to the space pen. For pocket use this pen is king and I highly recommend it.

My only potential qualm with it is that it compresses to perhaps too small a package (read \"easily lost\"). I've owned a few, and at least one is still out in the treeline. However, it's not enough of an issue to take away a star. In the end, it's just a pen, but it's the best I've ever owned."]}, {"Username":["Glenn E. Graham \"Glenn Earl\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I have used this pen for three years. It is NOT a everyday work pen. There are more comfortable pens for long term usage. It is the perfect pen to have with you always. The pen writes under every condition. It slips into your pocket without notice, but is there every time you need to make a note or fill out a form. You never have to ever worry about finding yourself needing to write when no pen is available or when the pen you are given will not make a line without drying up half way through. Great personal pen."]}, {"Username":["T. Baker"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I am not one to really get excited about pens. Normally just use a \"gel pen\" and don't think much about it. This pen was different though. I love that it's so small, which is why I purchased it. It's easy to put in your front pants pocket and carry with you for whenever inspiration strikes or you need to write down a list of what to pick up at the grocery. I use it a lot more than I expected to and it's been wonderful. No more forgetting the milk!"]}, {"Username":["JC"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I have two of these. Of all the pens I've ever used in my life, this is my favorite. Writes under water, upside down or whatever other position you need to write in.

As stated in the advertisement it seems to virtually write on any surface, and in any direction. Other pens would either put a hole in my pants pocket or sometimes my shirt pocket, what a nuisance. It's so durable and easy to carry around. I still have my first pen (approx 4 yrs). I use the pen absolutely every day and just put in my second refill 2 days before this post was written.

When it's capped, it's very small. I can stick it in my tiniest coin wallet with no problems. 3. The cap sticks so I never worry about it falling off in my purse. 4.

These write on a lot of things that would make an ordinary pen balk, such as thermal receipt paper or a glossy looking rebate form. The length is pretty interesting, it's very short when the cap is on, but with the cap reversed (ready to write), it's the length of a normal pen, a neat trick. It's a well built pen, black-painted brass. You'll lose it before ever wearing it out or damaging the shell. The only downside I've experienced with these is that there's no clip built-in, so they'll roll away very easily. I've made it a habit to put the cap back over the head of the pen and put it back in my pocket ASAP, that also helps me keep track of it better."]}, {"Username":["borego"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["The Space Pen is very smooth and sleek. If you want to carry it in you pocket then i would recommend the clip has an option. I carry this in my briefcase so i wont lose it. When you first open it up from the case it is a small pen, but after you open the pen to actually use it for written it opens to become a descent size length. Not to big or small. It writes very well which is a reason many people use this pen in other pen mods. I would recommend this pen to anyone and everyone."]}, {"Username":["John Doe"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["There are so many things to like about this pen: its compact size, its sturdiness and quality, its amazing pressurized ink technology, the list goes on. I've been carrying this pen with me in my pocket every day since I got it and it's come in handy countless times. I was a bit skeptical about how much use I would actually get out of it, but I've found myself using it numerous times each day. It's a joy to write with; the ink flows beautifully but it doesn't bleed through even thin paper. It writes on otherwise finicky materials like plastic rather well, and you never have to scribble it to get the ink flowing.

Love the way the pen has an etched pattern even where I hold the pen to write. That etching prevents the pen from slipping as I write! Nice! I like that it is made of brass since that metal is naturally antimicrobial (kills germs and viruses). The pressurized pen cartridge writes well. I bought this model and the one with the clip. They were both the same color and no difference other than the clip. I carry it in my pocket and I hardly notice it with my keys. Has already come in handy several times.

It worked forever and wrote at any angle, unlike other everyday pens. It seemed to have an unlimited supply of ink for such a small pen.

All kidding a side, the pen writes extremely well and the ink does not smear like others do when I write in the rain in my field books(I know should be using pencil). The pen is relatively small and compact wich is great if you have limited space to carry your day to day stuff. I highly recommend getting the attachment clip for the pen if ti does not already have it. Pros: -Size for traveling -fits in a pocket easily -waterproof(ie will not fail if it gets wet unlike others) -able to write upside down, although this has no bearing on me Cons -size(I have lost two) -some may find the pen to small even with the cap on it -mine came with a black ink cartridge and medium point, I like blue and fine points which was easily fixed. Would be nice to have the option when ordering. Overall decent pen that is perfect for the traveller or expat among us who has a limited space when traveling and wants a decent pen to be able to write with."]}, {"Username":["Larry Lee White \"larrylwhite\""],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["It is a must like keys and wallet everywhere I go.
