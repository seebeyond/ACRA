(But read on -- depending on your goals, it might be fine.) The description claims the clip is removable. I want the clip off most of the time because it stores better in the elastic band of my compact note pad that way. I paid the extra couple bucks for the clip figuring I'd rather have it when I need it. When it arrived, the clip was, for all intents and purposes, not removable. But I looked at the reviews here where people were complaining of it being too loose, and figured it probably just stuck during storage. I tried various ways of prying it off without scratching the pen in the process, but still managed to scratch the pen once without budging the clip... (annoying considering the price of the pen...). Finally the trick that worked was slipping a thin screwdriver into the loop of the clip and pulling straight up (the direction you would expect the clip to slide off the pen). With enough force, it finally popped free suddenly and came all the way off, leaving a mark under the clip where it had been adhered (besides the scratch I already made--so even if I'd done best approach from the start I'd still have a marred pen). Try this at your own risk... I couldn't guess whether it was intentionally glued (perhaps in response to complaints that it was too loose) or whether it was unintentionally adhered with paint. The clip is silver on the underside with overspray of black paint. Judging by other comments here (clip bending out, being too loose, etc.) I'd say the clip is just junk and will mostly just serve to damage your pen. Perhaps safer to get an after-market clip if you really want one (at least the paint should be dry by the time you put it on). On the other hand, if you never ever want to remove the clip, you could take the gamble that yours will be adhered like mine was, and if it doesn't bend out like it did on someone else here, it might be fine for your needs."]}]

(But read on -- depending on your goals, it might be fine.) The description claims the clip is removable. I want the clip off most of the time because it stores better in the elastic band of my compact note pad that way. I paid the extra couple bucks for the clip figuring I'd rather have it when I need it. When it arrived, the clip was, for all intents and purposes, not removable. But I looked at the reviews here where people were complaining of it being too loose, and figured it probably just stuck during storage. I tried various ways of prying it off without scratching the pen in the process, but still managed to scratch the pen once without budging the clip... (annoying considering the price of the pen...). Finally the trick that worked was slipping a thin screwdriver into the loop of the clip and pulling straight up (the direction you would expect the clip to slide off the pen). With enough force, it finally popped free suddenly and came all the way off, leaving a mark under the clip where it had been adhered (besides the scratch I already made--so even if I'd done best approach from the start I'd still have a marred pen). Try this at your own risk... I couldn't guess whether it was intentionally glued (perhaps in response to complaints that it was too loose) or whether it was unintentionally adhered with paint. The clip is silver on the underside with overspray of black paint. Judging by other comments here (clip bending out, being too loose, etc.) I'd say the clip is just junk and will mostly just serve to damage your pen. Perhaps safer to get an after-market clip if you really want one (at least the paint should be dry by the time you put it on). On the other hand, if you never ever want to remove the clip, you could take the gamble that yours will be adhered like mine was, and if it doesn't bend out like it did on someone else here, it might be fine for your needs."]}, {"Username":["Amazon Customer"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I absolutely Love this pen!

Ordinary pens, as most men (& some women, no doubt) realize, act like thermometers when carried in one's pocket.

(But read on -- depending on your goals, it might be fine.) The description claims the clip is removable. I want the clip off most of the time because it stores better in the elastic band of my compact note pad that way. I paid the extra couple bucks for the clip figuring I'd rather have it when I need it. When it arrived, the clip was, for all intents and purposes, not removable. But I looked at the reviews here where people were complaining of it being too loose, and figured it probably just stuck during storage. I tried various ways of prying it off without scratching the pen in the process, but still managed to scratch the pen once without budging the clip... (annoying considering the price of the pen...). Finally the trick that worked was slipping a thin screwdriver into the loop of the clip and pulling straight up (the direction you would expect the clip to slide off the pen). With enough force, it finally popped free suddenly and came all the way off, leaving a mark under the clip where it had been adhered (besides the scratch I already made--so even if I'd done best approach from the start I'd still have a marred pen). Try this at your own risk... I couldn't guess whether it was intentionally glued (perhaps in response to complaints that it was too loose) or whether it was unintentionally adhered with paint. The clip is silver on the underside with overspray of black paint. Judging by other comments here (clip bending out, being too loose, etc.) I'd say the clip is just junk and will mostly just serve to damage your pen. Perhaps safer to get an after-market clip if you really want one (at least the paint should be dry by the time you put it on).

When you open the pen for writing and put the cap on the back end it nearly doubles in size and is a very comfortable tool to write with. The black ink isn't the darkest but it's on par with Bic and the other dime-a-dozen cheap plastic pens. Only a felt tip pen will come out darker, but this is ballpoint so it's not a fair comparison.

Writes on anything I have tried so far (even those waxy like receipts from stores) with no problems at all. Often times I need to jot down notes or ideas and I always keep this in my pocket. It is so small when closed I don't even notice it in my front pocket! That being said though... at first I was keeping this in my front pocket with the clip. Bad decision as I often ride a bicycle for commuting and I actually lost it somewhere and was not able to find it! I ordered a second one because I loved the pen so much! I did order this exact same model (with the clip) because even though I don't use the clip in my pants pocket anymore (I think they/Fisher should make the clip with some kind of hook design on the end so that it makes sure that you mean to detach it from something rather than just sliding it off) I still don't feel it at all down in my pocket! It just disappears (mostly disappears - if it ends up sitting sideways in your pocket, depending on the pocket style on the pants, it might be felt some when you go to sit down - otherwise I don't really even feel it at all and sometimes I have to check to make sure it's still there.) If you want a reliable pen that is small when closed, regular sized when open, writes smooth and consistently with no skips, is precisely machined, has good looks and comes with a clip (I recommend using the clip on jacket arm pockets as seen on flight suits, pilot jackets, or pockets in shirts/dress shirts - Not clipped to pant pockets) then I recommend getting one of these pens. Comes in many intriguing colors to boot! Hope my opinion helps others!"]}]

Ordinary pens, as most men (& some women, no doubt) realize, act like thermometers when carried in one's pocket. Body temperature causes the ink in the cartridge to expand, leading to leaks, ruptures & other non-performance. Pencils break. The pen is considerably smaller & thinner than I expected. It also sports my least favorite implement: the medium ballpoint. I also fretted over the detached cap. One more thing to loose. After a couple of months, however, I'm completely sold. It's thinness permits it to fit snugly into the rings of the small binder notebooks I use, greatly reducing the tendency to get lost or become a headache to find while covering a speech or interviewing. The ink flows perfectly, never pools or threatens to leak. Although I have large hands I find it very easy to write with (size of the pads I carry in pocket is much more of an issue that cramps my writing). People are idiosyncratic & highly individual in what we prefer to write with--I've always been a pencil guy--but the Fisher, appearing to embody everything I don't like in a pen, has completely won me over. I have to stop myself from pulling it out of my pocket to write with at home--but it's ink supply probably isn't infinite, & they are a bit costly to replace.

(But read on -- depending on your goals, it might be fine.) The description claims the clip is removable. I want the clip off most of the time because it stores better in the elastic band of my compact note pad that way. I paid the extra couple bucks for the clip figuring I'd rather have it when I need it. When it arrived, the clip was, for all intents and purposes, not removable. But I looked at the reviews here where people were complaining of it being too loose, and figured it probably just stuck during storage. I tried various ways of prying it off without scratching the pen in the process, but still managed to scratch the pen once without budging the clip... (annoying considering the price of the pen...). Finally the trick that worked was slipping a thin screwdriver into the loop of the clip and pulling straight up (the direction you would expect the clip to slide off the pen). With enough force, it finally popped free suddenly and came all the way off, leaving a mark under the clip where it had been adhered (besides the scratch I already made--so even if I'd done best approach from the start I'd still have a marred pen). Try this at your own risk... I couldn't guess whether it was intentionally glued (perhaps in response to complaints that it was too loose) or whether it was unintentionally adhered with paint. The clip is silver on the underside with overspray of black paint. Judging by other comments here (clip bending out, being too loose, etc.) I'd say the clip is just junk and will mostly just serve to damage your pen. Perhaps safer to get an after-market clip if you really want one (at least the paint should be dry by the time you put it on). On the other hand, if you never ever want to remove the clip, you could take the gamble that yours will be adhered like mine was, and if it doesn't bend out like it did on someone else here, it might be fine for your needs."]}, {"Username":["Amazon Customer"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I absolutely Love this pen!

I want the clip off most of the time because it stores better in the elastic band of my compact note pad that way.

Bad decision as I often ride a bicycle for commuting and I actually lost it somewhere and was not able to find it! I ordered a second one because I loved the pen so much! I did order this exact same model (with the clip) because even though I don't use the clip in my pants pocket anymore (I think they/Fisher should make the clip with some kind of hook design on the end so that it makes sure that you mean to detach it from something rather than just sliding it off) I still don't feel it at all down in my pocket! It just disappears (mostly disappears - if it ends up sitting sideways in your pocket, depending on the pocket style on the pants, it might be felt some when you go to sit down - otherwise I don't really even feel it at all and sometimes I have to check to make sure it's still there.) If you want a reliable pen that is small when closed, regular sized when open, writes smooth and consistently with no skips, is precisely machined, has good looks and comes with a clip (I recommend using the clip on jacket arm pockets as seen on flight suits, pilot jackets, or pockets in shirts/dress shirts - Not clipped to pant pockets) then I recommend getting one of these pens.

Ordinary pens, as most men (& some women, no doubt) realize, act like thermometers when carried in one's pocket. Body temperature causes the ink in the cartridge to expand, leading to leaks, ruptures & other non-performance. Pencils break. The pen is considerably smaller & thinner than I expected. It also sports my least favorite implement: the medium ballpoint. I also fretted over the detached cap. One more thing to loose. After a couple of months, however, I'm completely sold. It's thinness permits it to fit snugly into the rings of the small binder notebooks I use, greatly reducing the tendency to get lost or become a headache to find while covering a speech or interviewing. The ink flows perfectly, never pools or threatens to leak. Although I have large hands I find it very easy to write with (size of the pads I carry in pocket is much more of an issue that cramps my writing). People are idiosyncratic & highly individual in what we prefer to write with--I've always been a pencil guy--but the Fisher, appearing to embody everything I don't like in a pen, has completely won me over. I have to stop myself from pulling it out of my pocket to write with at home--but it's ink supply probably isn't infinite, & they are a bit costly to replace.

(But read on -- depending on your goals, it might be fine.) The description claims the clip is removable. I want the clip off most of the time because it stores better in the elastic band of my compact note pad that way. I paid the extra couple bucks for the clip figuring I'd rather have it when I need it. When it arrived, the clip was, for all intents and purposes, not removable. But I looked at the reviews here where people were complaining of it being too loose, and figured it probably just stuck during storage. I tried various ways of prying it off without scratching the pen in the process, but still managed to scratch the pen once without budging the clip... (annoying considering the price of the pen...). Finally the trick that worked was slipping a thin screwdriver into the loop of the clip and pulling straight up (the direction you would expect the clip to slide off the pen). With enough force, it finally popped free suddenly and came all the way off, leaving a mark under the clip where it had been adhered (besides the scratch I already made--so even if I'd done best approach from the start I'd still have a marred pen). Try this at your own risk... I couldn't guess whether it was intentionally glued (perhaps in response to complaints that it was too loose) or whether it was unintentionally adhered with paint. The clip is silver on the underside with overspray of black paint. Judging by other comments here (clip bending out, being too loose, etc.) I'd say the clip is just junk and will mostly just serve to damage your pen. Perhaps safer to get an after-market clip if you really want one (at least the paint should be dry by the time you put it on). On the other hand, if you never ever want to remove the clip, you could take the gamble that yours will be adhered like mine was, and if it doesn't bend out like it did on someone else here, it might be fine for your needs."]}, {"Username":["Amazon Customer"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I absolutely Love this pen!

(But read on -- depending on your goals, it might be fine.) The description claims the clip is removable. I want the clip off most of the time because it stores better in the elastic band of my compact note pad that way. I paid the extra couple bucks for the clip figuring I'd rather have it when I need it. When it arrived, the clip was, for all intents and purposes, not removable. But I looked at the reviews here where people were complaining of it being too loose, and figured it probably just stuck during storage. I tried various ways of prying it off without scratching the pen in the process, but still managed to scratch the pen once without budging the clip... (annoying considering the price of the pen...). Finally the trick that worked was slipping a thin screwdriver into the loop of the clip and pulling straight up (the direction you would expect the clip to slide off the pen). With enough force, it finally popped free suddenly and came all the way off, leaving a mark under the clip where it had been adhered (besides the scratch I already made--so even if I'd done best approach from the start I'd still have a marred pen). Try this at your own risk... I couldn't guess whether it was intentionally glued (perhaps in response to complaints that it was too loose) or whether it was unintentionally adhered with paint. The clip is silver on the underside with overspray of black paint. Judging by other comments here (clip bending out, being too loose, etc.) I'd say the clip is just junk and will mostly just serve to damage your pen. Perhaps safer to get an after-market clip if you really want one (at least the paint should be dry by the time you put it on). On the other hand, if you never ever want to remove the clip, you could take the gamble that yours will be adhered like mine was, and if it doesn't bend out like it did on someone else here, it might be fine for your needs."]}, {"Username":["Amazon Customer"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I absolutely Love this pen!

When you open the pen for writing and put the cap on the back end it nearly doubles in size and is a very comfortable tool to write with. The black ink isn't the darkest but it's on par with Bic and the other dime-a-dozen cheap plastic pens. Only a felt tip pen will come out darker, but this is ballpoint so it's not a fair comparison.

Bad decision as I often ride a bicycle for commuting and I actually lost it somewhere and was not able to find it! I ordered a second one because I loved the pen so much! I did order this exact same model (with the clip) because even though I don't use the clip in my pants pocket anymore (I think they/Fisher should make the clip with some kind of hook design on the end so that it makes sure that you mean to detach it from something rather than just sliding it off) I still don't feel it at all down in my pocket! It just disappears (mostly disappears - if it ends up sitting sideways in your pocket, depending on the pocket style on the pants, it might be felt some when you go to sit down - otherwise I don't really even feel it at all and sometimes I have to check to make sure it's still there.) If you want a reliable pen that is small when closed, regular sized when open, writes smooth and consistently with no skips, is precisely machined, has good looks and comes with a clip (I recommend using the clip on jacket arm pockets as seen on flight suits, pilot jackets, or pockets in shirts/dress shirts - Not clipped to pant pockets) then I recommend getting one of these pens.

Ordinary pens, as most men (& some women, no doubt) realize, act like thermometers when carried in one's pocket. Body temperature causes the ink in the cartridge to expand, leading to leaks, ruptures & other non-performance. Pencils break. The pen is considerably smaller & thinner than I expected. It also sports my least favorite implement: the medium ballpoint. I also fretted over the detached cap. One more thing to loose. After a couple of months, however, I'm completely sold. It's thinness permits it to fit snugly into the rings of the small binder notebooks I use, greatly reducing the tendency to get lost or become a headache to find while covering a speech or interviewing. The ink flows perfectly, never pools or threatens to leak. Although I have large hands I find it very easy to write with (size of the pads I carry in pocket is much more of an issue that cramps my writing). People are idiosyncratic & highly individual in what we prefer to write with--I've always been a pencil guy--but the Fisher, appearing to embody everything I don't like in a pen, has completely won me over. I have to stop myself from pulling it out of my pocket to write with at home--but it's ink supply probably isn't infinite, & they are a bit costly to replace.

Ordinary pens, as most men (& some women, no doubt) realize, act like thermometers when carried in one's pocket. Body temperature causes the ink in the cartridge to expand, leading to leaks, ruptures & other non-performance. Pencils break. The pen is considerably smaller & thinner than I expected. It also sports my least favorite implement: the medium ballpoint. I also fretted over the detached cap. One more thing to loose. After a couple of months, however, I'm completely sold. It's thinness permits it to fit snugly into the rings of the small binder notebooks I use, greatly reducing the tendency to get lost or become a headache to find while covering a speech or interviewing. The ink flows perfectly, never pools or threatens to leak. Although I have large hands I find it very easy to write with (size of the pads I carry in pocket is much more of an issue that cramps my writing). People are idiosyncratic & highly individual in what we prefer to write with--I've always been a pencil guy--but the Fisher, appearing to embody everything I don't like in a pen, has completely won me over. I have to stop myself from pulling it out of my pocket to write with at home--but it's ink supply probably isn't infinite, & they are a bit costly to replace.

The ink flows smoothly and the writing experience is somewhere between that of a cheap ballpoint and luxurious fountain pen. The top is held on by a rubberized gasket and the pen has the heft of an empty rifle cartridge. I wear it in pocketed button-down shirts and love its unobtrusiveness. It's also tough enough to be clipped in your back pocket and sat on. It can also be clipped onto a T-shirt or into athletic shorts.

(But read on -- depending on your goals, it might be fine.) The description claims the clip is removable. I want the clip off most of the time because it stores better in the elastic band of my compact note pad that way. I paid the extra couple bucks for the clip figuring I'd rather have it when I need it. When it arrived, the clip was, for all intents and purposes, not removable. But I looked at the reviews here where people were complaining of it being too loose, and figured it probably just stuck during storage. I tried various ways of prying it off without scratching the pen in the process, but still managed to scratch the pen once without budging the clip... (annoying considering the price of the pen...). Finally the trick that worked was slipping a thin screwdriver into the loop of the clip and pulling straight up (the direction you would expect the clip to slide off the pen). With enough force, it finally popped free suddenly and came all the way off, leaving a mark under the clip where it had been adhered (besides the scratch I already made--so even if I'd done best approach from the start I'd still have a marred pen). Try this at your own risk... I couldn't guess whether it was intentionally glued (perhaps in response to complaints that it was too loose) or whether it was unintentionally adhered with paint. The clip is silver on the underside with overspray of black paint. Judging by other comments here (clip bending out, being too loose, etc.) I'd say the clip is just junk and will mostly just serve to damage your pen. Perhaps safer to get an after-market clip if you really want one (at least the paint should be dry by the time you put it on). On the other hand, if you never ever want to remove the clip, you could take the gamble that yours will be adhered like mine was, and if it doesn't bend out like it did on someone else here, it might be fine for your needs."]}, {"Username":["Amazon Customer"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I absolutely Love this pen!

When you open the pen for writing and put the cap on the back end it nearly doubles in size and is a very comfortable tool to write with. The black ink isn't the darkest but it's on par with Bic and the other dime-a-dozen cheap plastic pens. Only a felt tip pen will come out darker, but this is ballpoint so it's not a fair comparison.

Bad decision as I often ride a bicycle for commuting and I actually lost it somewhere and was not able to find it! I ordered a second one because I loved the pen so much! I did order this exact same model (with the clip) because even though I don't use the clip in my pants pocket anymore (I think they/Fisher should make the clip with some kind of hook design on the end so that it makes sure that you mean to detach it from something rather than just sliding it off) I still don't feel it at all down in my pocket! It just disappears (mostly disappears - if it ends up sitting sideways in your pocket, depending on the pocket style on the pants, it might be felt some when you go to sit down - otherwise I don't really even feel it at all and sometimes I have to check to make sure it's still there.) If you want a reliable pen that is small when closed, regular sized when open, writes smooth and consistently with no skips, is precisely machined, has good looks and comes with a clip (I recommend using the clip on jacket arm pockets as seen on flight suits, pilot jackets, or pockets in shirts/dress shirts - Not clipped to pant pockets) then I recommend getting one of these pens.

I did order this exact same model (with the clip) because even though I don't use the clip in my pants pocket anymore (I think they/Fisher should make the clip with some kind of hook design on the end so that it makes sure that you mean to detach it from something rather than just sliding it off) I still don't feel it at all down in my pocket! It just disappears (mostly disappears - if it ends up sitting sideways in your pocket, depending on the pocket style on the pants, it might be felt some when you go to sit down - otherwise I don't really even feel it at all and sometimes I have to check to make sure it's still there.) If you want a reliable pen that is small when closed, regular sized when open, writes smooth and consistently with no skips, is precisely machined, has good looks and comes with a clip (I recommend using the clip on jacket arm pockets as seen on flight suits, pilot jackets, or pockets in shirts/dress shirts - Not clipped to pant pockets) then I recommend getting one of these pens.

Ordinary pens, as most men (& some women, no doubt) realize, act like thermometers when carried in one's pocket. Body temperature causes the ink in the cartridge to expand, leading to leaks, ruptures & other non-performance. Pencils break. The pen is considerably smaller & thinner than I expected. It also sports my least favorite implement: the medium ballpoint. I also fretted over the detached cap. One more thing to loose. After a couple of months, however, I'm completely sold. It's thinness permits it to fit snugly into the rings of the small binder notebooks I use, greatly reducing the tendency to get lost or become a headache to find while covering a speech or interviewing. The ink flows perfectly, never pools or threatens to leak. Although I have large hands I find it very easy to write with (size of the pads I carry in pocket is much more of an issue that cramps my writing). People are idiosyncratic & highly individual in what we prefer to write with--I've always been a pencil guy--but the Fisher, appearing to embody everything I don't like in a pen, has completely won me over. I have to stop myself from pulling it out of my pocket to write with at home--but it's ink supply probably isn't infinite, & they are a bit costly to replace.

Ordinary pens, as most men (& some women, no doubt) realize, act like thermometers when carried in one's pocket. Body temperature causes the ink in the cartridge to expand, leading to leaks, ruptures & other non-performance. Pencils break. The pen is considerably smaller & thinner than I expected. It also sports my least favorite implement: the medium ballpoint. I also fretted over the detached cap. One more thing to loose. After a couple of months, however, I'm completely sold. It's thinness permits it to fit snugly into the rings of the small binder notebooks I use, greatly reducing the tendency to get lost or become a headache to find while covering a speech or interviewing. The ink flows perfectly, never pools or threatens to leak. Although I have large hands I find it very easy to write with (size of the pads I carry in pocket is much more of an issue that cramps my writing). People are idiosyncratic & highly individual in what we prefer to write with--I've always been a pencil guy--but the Fisher, appearing to embody everything I don't like in a pen, has completely won me over. I have to stop myself from pulling it out of my pocket to write with at home--but it's ink supply probably isn't infinite, & they are a bit costly to replace.

The ink flows smoothly and the writing experience is somewhere between that of a cheap ballpoint and luxurious fountain pen. The top is held on by a rubberized gasket and the pen has the heft of an empty rifle cartridge. I wear it in pocketed button-down shirts and love its unobtrusiveness. It's also tough enough to be clipped in your back pocket and sat on. It can also be clipped onto a T-shirt or into athletic shorts.

(But read on -- depending on your goals, it might be fine.) The description claims the clip is removable. I want the clip off most of the time because it stores better in the elastic band of my compact note pad that way. I paid the extra couple bucks for the clip figuring I'd rather have it when I need it. When it arrived, the clip was, for all intents and purposes, not removable. But I looked at the reviews here where people were complaining of it being too loose, and figured it probably just stuck during storage. I tried various ways of prying it off without scratching the pen in the process, but still managed to scratch the pen once without budging the clip... (annoying considering the price of the pen...). Finally the trick that worked was slipping a thin screwdriver into the loop of the clip and pulling straight up (the direction you would expect the clip to slide off the pen). With enough force, it finally popped free suddenly and came all the way off, leaving a mark under the clip where it had been adhered (besides the scratch I already made--so even if I'd done best approach from the start I'd still have a marred pen). Try this at your own risk... I couldn't guess whether it was intentionally glued (perhaps in response to complaints that it was too loose) or whether it was unintentionally adhered with paint. The clip is silver on the underside with overspray of black paint. Judging by other comments here (clip bending out, being too loose, etc.) I'd say the clip is just junk and will mostly just serve to damage your pen. Perhaps safer to get an after-market clip if you really want one (at least the paint should be dry by the time you put it on). On the other hand, if you never ever want to remove the clip, you could take the gamble that yours will be adhered like mine was, and if it doesn't bend out like it did on someone else here, it might be fine for your needs."]}, {"Username":["Amazon Customer"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I absolutely Love this pen!

(But read on -- depending on your goals, it might be fine.) The description claims the clip is removable. I want the clip off most of the time because it stores better in the elastic band of my compact note pad that way. I paid the extra couple bucks for the clip figuring I'd rather have it when I need it. When it arrived, the clip was, for all intents and purposes, not removable. But I looked at the reviews here where people were complaining of it being too loose, and figured it probably just stuck during storage. I tried various ways of prying it off without scratching the pen in the process, but still managed to scratch the pen once without budging the clip... (annoying considering the price of the pen...). Finally the trick that worked was slipping a thin screwdriver into the loop of the clip and pulling straight up (the direction you would expect the clip to slide off the pen). With enough force, it finally popped free suddenly and came all the way off, leaving a mark under the clip where it had been adhered (besides the scratch I already made--so even if I'd done best approach from the start I'd still have a marred pen). Try this at your own risk... I couldn't guess whether it was intentionally glued (perhaps in response to complaints that it was too loose) or whether it was unintentionally adhered with paint. The clip is silver on the underside with overspray of black paint. Judging by other comments here (clip bending out, being too loose, etc.) I'd say the clip is just junk and will mostly just serve to damage your pen. Perhaps safer to get an after-market clip if you really want one (at least the paint should be dry by the time you put it on). On the other hand, if you never ever want to remove the clip, you could take the gamble that yours will be adhered like mine was, and if it doesn't bend out like it did on someone else here, it might be fine for your needs."]}, {"Username":["Amazon Customer"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I absolutely Love this pen!

I did order this exact same model (with the clip) because even though I don't use the clip in my pants pocket anymore (I think they/Fisher should make the clip with some kind of hook design on the end so that it makes sure that you mean to detach it from something rather than just sliding it off) I still don't feel it at all down in my pocket!

If you want a reliable pen that is small when closed, regular sized when open, writes smooth and consistently with no skips, is precisely machined, has good looks and comes with a clip (I recommend using the clip on jacket arm pockets as seen on flight suits, pilot jackets, or pockets in shirts/dress shirts - Not clipped to pant pockets) then I recommend getting one of these pens.

(But read on -- depending on your goals, it might be fine.) The description claims the clip is removable. I want the clip off most of the time because it stores better in the elastic band of my compact note pad that way. I paid the extra couple bucks for the clip figuring I'd rather have it when I need it. When it arrived, the clip was, for all intents and purposes, not removable. But I looked at the reviews here where people were complaining of it being too loose, and figured it probably just stuck during storage. I tried various ways of prying it off without scratching the pen in the process, but still managed to scratch the pen once without budging the clip... (annoying considering the price of the pen...). Finally the trick that worked was slipping a thin screwdriver into the loop of the clip and pulling straight up (the direction you would expect the clip to slide off the pen). With enough force, it finally popped free suddenly and came all the way off, leaving a mark under the clip where it had been adhered (besides the scratch I already made--so even if I'd done best approach from the start I'd still have a marred pen). Try this at your own risk... I couldn't guess whether it was intentionally glued (perhaps in response to complaints that it was too loose) or whether it was unintentionally adhered with paint. The clip is silver on the underside with overspray of black paint. Judging by other comments here (clip bending out, being too loose, etc.) I'd say the clip is just junk and will mostly just serve to damage your pen. Perhaps safer to get an after-market clip if you really want one (at least the paint should be dry by the time you put it on). On the other hand, if you never ever want to remove the clip, you could take the gamble that yours will be adhered like mine was, and if it doesn't bend out like it did on someone else here, it might be fine for your needs."]}, {"Username":["Amazon Customer"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I absolutely Love this pen!

When you open the pen for writing and put the cap on the back end it nearly doubles in size and is a very comfortable tool to write with. The black ink isn't the darkest but it's on par with Bic and the other dime-a-dozen cheap plastic pens. Only a felt tip pen will come out darker, but this is ballpoint so it's not a fair comparison.

I did order this exact same model (with the clip) because even though I don't use the clip in my pants pocket anymore (I think they/Fisher should make the clip with some kind of hook design on the end so that it makes sure that you mean to detach it from something rather than just sliding it off) I still don't feel it at all down in my pocket! It just disappears (mostly disappears - if it ends up sitting sideways in your pocket, depending on the pocket style on the pants, it might be felt some when you go to sit down - otherwise I don't really even feel it at all and sometimes I have to check to make sure it's still there.) If you want a reliable pen that is small when closed, regular sized when open, writes smooth and consistently with no skips, is precisely machined, has good looks and comes with a clip (I recommend using the clip on jacket arm pockets as seen on flight suits, pilot jackets, or pockets in shirts/dress shirts - Not clipped to pant pockets) then I recommend getting one of these pens.

Ordinary pens, as most men (& some women, no doubt) realize, act like thermometers when carried in one's pocket. Body temperature causes the ink in the cartridge to expand, leading to leaks, ruptures & other non-performance. Pencils break. The pen is considerably smaller & thinner than I expected. It also sports my least favorite implement: the medium ballpoint. I also fretted over the detached cap. One more thing to loose. After a couple of months, however, I'm completely sold. It's thinness permits it to fit snugly into the rings of the small binder notebooks I use, greatly reducing the tendency to get lost or become a headache to find while covering a speech or interviewing. The ink flows perfectly, never pools or threatens to leak. Although I have large hands I find it very easy to write with (size of the pads I carry in pocket is much more of an issue that cramps my writing). People are idiosyncratic & highly individual in what we prefer to write with--I've always been a pencil guy--but the Fisher, appearing to embody everything I don't like in a pen, has completely won me over.

Ordinary pens, as most men (& some women, no doubt) realize, act like thermometers when carried in one's pocket. Body temperature causes the ink in the cartridge to expand, leading to leaks, ruptures & other non-performance. Pencils break. The pen is considerably smaller & thinner than I expected. It also sports my least favorite implement: the medium ballpoint. I also fretted over the detached cap. One more thing to loose. After a couple of months, however, I'm completely sold. It's thinness permits it to fit snugly into the rings of the small binder notebooks I use, greatly reducing the tendency to get lost or become a headache to find while covering a speech or interviewing. The ink flows perfectly, never pools or threatens to leak. Although I have large hands I find it very easy to write with (size of the pads I carry in pocket is much more of an issue that cramps my writing). People are idiosyncratic & highly individual in what we prefer to write with--I've always been a pencil guy--but the Fisher, appearing to embody everything I don't like in a pen, has completely won me over.

It just disappears (mostly disappears - if it ends up sitting sideways in your pocket, depending on the pocket style on the pants, it might be felt some when you go to sit down - otherwise I don't really even feel it at all and sometimes I have to check to make sure it's still there.) If you want a reliable pen that is small when closed, regular sized when open, writes smooth and consistently with no skips, is precisely machined, has good looks and comes with a clip (I recommend using the clip on jacket arm pockets as seen on flight suits, pilot jackets, or pockets in shirts/dress shirts - Not clipped to pant pockets) then I recommend getting one of these pens.

Ordinary pens, as most men (& some women, no doubt) realize, act like thermometers when carried in one's pocket. Body temperature causes the ink in the cartridge to expand, leading to leaks, ruptures & other non-performance. Pencils break. The pen is considerably smaller & thinner than I expected. It also sports my least favorite implement: the medium ballpoint. I also fretted over the detached cap. One more thing to loose. After a couple of months, however, I'm completely sold. It's thinness permits it to fit snugly into the rings of the small binder notebooks I use, greatly reducing the tendency to get lost or become a headache to find while covering a speech or interviewing. The ink flows perfectly, never pools or threatens to leak. Although I have large hands I find it very easy to write with (size of the pads I carry in pocket is much more of an issue that cramps my writing). People are idiosyncratic & highly individual in what we prefer to write with--I've always been a pencil guy--but the Fisher, appearing to embody everything I don't like in a pen, has completely won me over. I have to stop myself from pulling it out of my pocket to write with at home--but it's ink supply probably isn't infinite, & they are a bit costly to replace.

(But read on -- depending on your goals, it might be fine.) The description claims the clip is removable. I want the clip off most of the time because it stores better in the elastic band of my compact note pad that way. I paid the extra couple bucks for the clip figuring I'd rather have it when I need it. When it arrived, the clip was, for all intents and purposes, not removable. But I looked at the reviews here where people were complaining of it being too loose, and figured it probably just stuck during storage. I tried various ways of prying it off without scratching the pen in the process, but still managed to scratch the pen once without budging the clip... (annoying considering the price of the pen...). Finally the trick that worked was slipping a thin screwdriver into the loop of the clip and pulling straight up (the direction you would expect the clip to slide off the pen). With enough force, it finally popped free suddenly and came all the way off, leaving a mark under the clip where it had been adhered (besides the scratch I already made--so even if I'd done best approach from the start I'd still have a marred pen). Try this at your own risk... I couldn't guess whether it was intentionally glued (perhaps in response to complaints that it was too loose) or whether it was unintentionally adhered with paint. The clip is silver on the underside with overspray of black paint. Judging by other comments here (clip bending out, being too loose, etc.) I'd say the clip is just junk and will mostly just serve to damage your pen. Perhaps safer to get an after-market clip if you really want one (at least the paint should be dry by the time you put it on). On the other hand, if you never ever want to remove the clip, you could take the gamble that yours will be adhered like mine was, and if it doesn't bend out like it did on someone else here, it might be fine for your needs."]}, {"Username":["Amazon Customer"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I absolutely Love this pen!

I like the small, go anywhere size and when you put the cap on the rear portion, it becomes a full sized writer. Because of the size, I find that I carry it with me most of the time. Great pen."]}, {"Username":["Leal, chris"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["This little pen will fit just about anywhere, writes nice and smooth, and its a space pen so yeah, I recommend this item."]}, {"Username":["chautime"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["The case is metal, the ink flows well, it writes in any condition, it shrinks to a pocketable size and the clasp is sturdy and doesn't come off. My only complaint is that the black on the side of the clip has scraped off, showing the silver underneath. Not a huge deal but it is strange to see little bits of silver on a completely black pen."]}, {"Username":["Michael"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I was thrilled to have what seemed like the most reliable pen you can buy. It was completely useless right out of the box. Doesn't write unless you point it perfectly vertical, and then then it won't write very dark. I will be returning and getting a replacement. I'm hoping mine was just defective. EDIT!!!! Amazon made an exchange a breeze, my previous pen must have been defective because the replacement is lovely. The matte black finish has a sort of brushed metal texture and looks fantastic. I also thought the clip was silver from the picture but it is also black. The pen writes perfectly and smooth, and the best part about this pen is that when closed it is very small and perfect for every day carry in a pocket, but when opened and the cap put on the back, it is a full size pen and feels great in the hand."]}]
