If the latter, then this seller should disclose the fact. If the former, well then... In any event the chip works for my purpose, so I'm giving 2 stars.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion. So 7.45 Giga-Byte comes to just about 8 billion bytes, which means '8GB' to marketing people."]}, {"Username":["Dimitri"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["kingston card with a generic adapter in questionable packaging ... read and write rates not where they're supposed to be ... card was used and scratches were present at the micro sd card.

But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion. So 7.45 Giga-Byte comes to just about 8 billion bytes, which means '8GB' to marketing people."]}, {"Username":["Dimitri"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["kingston card with a generic adapter in questionable packaging ... read and write rates not where they're supposed to be ... card was used and scratches were present at the micro sd card.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion.

This product is the only exception to date, but it so horribly under performs that other potential customers deserve a warning. I bought this card to replace the 8GB Class2 Sandisk card that came with my HTC EVO. The first step to swapping out cards once I got them, was to transfer my files to my computer (I don't have 2 card readers). I used the adapter that came with the Kingston microSD card to plug my Sandisk microSD card into my computer and transferred all my files (about 3GB) to my a folder on my desktop. The Sandisk card gave a very respectable (for a class2 device) 4.5 MB/s transfer rate. When transferring the same files to the Kingston card using the same card adapter and SD slot, the transfer rate maxed out a 50 KB/s. It would have taken me more than 10 hours to transfer my files from my PC to the Kingston card. A Class 4 device should have a _minimum_ sustained write speed of 4 MB/s.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion. So 7.45 Giga-Byte comes to just about 8 billion bytes, which means '8GB' to marketing people."]}, {"Username":["Dimitri"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["kingston card with a generic adapter in questionable packaging ... read and write rates not where they're supposed to be ... card was used and scratches were present at the micro sd card.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion. So 7.45 Giga-Byte comes to just about 8 billion bytes, which means '8GB' to marketing people."]}, {"Username":["Dimitri"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["kingston card with a generic adapter in questionable packaging ... read and write rates not where they're supposed to be ... card was used and scratches were present at the micro sd card.

This product is the only exception to date, but it so horribly under performs that other potential customers deserve a warning. I bought this card to replace the 8GB Class2 Sandisk card that came with my HTC EVO. The first step to swapping out cards once I got them, was to transfer my files to my computer (I don't have 2 card readers). I used the adapter that came with the Kingston microSD card to plug my Sandisk microSD card into my computer and transferred all my files (about 3GB) to my a folder on my desktop. The Sandisk card gave a very respectable (for a class2 device) 4.5 MB/s transfer rate. When transferring the same files to the Kingston card using the same card adapter and SD slot, the transfer rate maxed out a 50 KB/s. It would have taken me more than 10 hours to transfer my files from my PC to the Kingston card. A Class 4 device should have a _minimum_ sustained write speed of 4 MB/s. I ordered this product fulfilled by Amazon, and I am sure Amazon is not sending me any knock-off products.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion.

This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion.

This product is the only exception to date, but it so horribly under performs that other potential customers deserve a warning. I bought this card to replace the 8GB Class2 Sandisk card that came with my HTC EVO. The first step to swapping out cards once I got them, was to transfer my files to my computer (I don't have 2 card readers). I used the adapter that came with the Kingston microSD card to plug my Sandisk microSD card into my computer and transferred all my files (about 3GB) to my a folder on my desktop. The Sandisk card gave a very respectable (for a class2 device) 4.5 MB/s transfer rate. When transferring the same files to the Kingston card using the same card adapter and SD slot, the transfer rate maxed out a 50 KB/s. It would have taken me more than 10 hours to transfer my files from my PC to the Kingston card. A Class 4 device should have a _minimum_ sustained write speed of 4 MB/s. I ordered this product fulfilled by Amazon, and I am sure Amazon is not sending me any knock-off products.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion. So 7.45 Giga-Byte comes to just about 8 billion bytes, which means '8GB' to marketing people."]}, {"Username":["Dimitri"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["kingston card with a generic adapter in questionable packaging ... read and write rates not where they're supposed to be ... card was used and scratches were present at the micro sd card.

NOT ON SEALED PACKAGE, just plain card plastic case.. which looks kinda cheap too (thin and very easy to open)... i mean i feel it could have been a fake card... or a used one. NEXT i opened the case amd it and looked at the MicroSd card closely and focused on the lil yellow Metal connectors and you could see that they were scratched!! or if u may... used.. i kinda panicked... i looked at the SD adapter and it had no scratches... but the Micro sd card had sings of usage... i was like REALLY??! perhaps it has been benchmarked by the seller... which it should had been stated.. as refurbished cuz they are not marked like that BRAND NEW! Thereafter i went for some benchmarking myself and at first it seemed to be a rip off cuz i can only get close the 4MB per second (3.83MB/s to be exact).. i KNOW the MINIMUM for Class 4 its 4MB/s on the Transfer test... but i owned smaller size class 4 cards and they always OVER the 4 MB/s on the writing, i mean it totally depends on the type of file and the device but this myth its looking busted!! But On the Reading test it gets to up to 11MB/s but the 3.83MB/s writing kinda annoys me.. but this test its been done on my android... so .... i think before i come with a final conclusion i have to test it on a PC with a straight up card reader. >>>UPDATE: i tested it with a PC program and a straight up system adapter and i got the same.. the card seem to be struggling to stay on the 3MB/s on the writing with a 300MB file and it actually dropped to 2.45MB/s on writing at one time!! i dont care how fast the reading is.. this is going back to the seller.

This product is the only exception to date, but it so horribly under performs that other potential customers deserve a warning. I bought this card to replace the 8GB Class2 Sandisk card that came with my HTC EVO. The first step to swapping out cards once I got them, was to transfer my files to my computer (I don't have 2 card readers). I used the adapter that came with the Kingston microSD card to plug my Sandisk microSD card into my computer and transferred all my files (about 3GB) to my a folder on my desktop. The Sandisk card gave a very respectable (for a class2 device) 4.5 MB/s transfer rate. When transferring the same files to the Kingston card using the same card adapter and SD slot, the transfer rate maxed out a 50 KB/s. It would have taken me more than 10 hours to transfer my files from my PC to the Kingston card. A Class 4 device should have a _minimum_ sustained write speed of 4 MB/s. I ordered this product fulfilled by Amazon, and I am sure Amazon is not sending me any knock-off products.

This product is the only exception to date, but it so horribly under performs that other potential customers deserve a warning. I bought this card to replace the 8GB Class2 Sandisk card that came with my HTC EVO. The first step to swapping out cards once I got them, was to transfer my files to my computer (I don't have 2 card readers). I used the adapter that came with the Kingston microSD card to plug my Sandisk microSD card into my computer and transferred all my files (about 3GB) to my a folder on my desktop. The Sandisk card gave a very respectable (for a class2 device) 4.5 MB/s transfer rate. When transferring the same files to the Kingston card using the same card adapter and SD slot, the transfer rate maxed out a 50 KB/s. It would have taken me more than 10 hours to transfer my files from my PC to the Kingston card. A Class 4 device should have a _minimum_ sustained write speed of 4 MB/s. I ordered this product fulfilled by Amazon, and I am sure Amazon is not sending me any knock-off products.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion. So 7.45 Giga-Byte comes to just about 8 billion bytes, which means '8GB' to marketing people."]}, {"Username":["Dimitri"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["kingston card with a generic adapter in questionable packaging ... read and write rates not where they're supposed to be ... card was used and scratches were present at the micro sd card.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion. So 7.45 Giga-Byte comes to just about 8 billion bytes, which means '8GB' to marketing people."]}, {"Username":["Dimitri"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["kingston card with a generic adapter in questionable packaging ... read and write rates not where they're supposed to be ... card was used and scratches were present at the micro sd card.

This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion.

I bought this card to replace the 8GB Class2 Sandisk card that came with my HTC EVO. The first step to swapping out cards once I got them, was to transfer my files to my computer (I don't have 2 card readers). I used the adapter that came with the Kingston microSD card to plug my Sandisk microSD card into my computer and transferred all my files (about 3GB) to my a folder on my desktop. The Sandisk card gave a very respectable (for a class2 device) 4.5 MB/s transfer rate. When transferring the same files to the Kingston card using the same card adapter and SD slot, the transfer rate maxed out a 50 KB/s. It would have taken me more than 10 hours to transfer my files from my PC to the Kingston card. A Class 4 device should have a _minimum_ sustained write speed of 4 MB/s.

This product is the only exception to date, but it so horribly under performs that other potential customers deserve a warning. I bought this card to replace the 8GB Class2 Sandisk card that came with my HTC EVO. The first step to swapping out cards once I got them, was to transfer my files to my computer (I don't have 2 card readers). I used the adapter that came with the Kingston microSD card to plug my Sandisk microSD card into my computer and transferred all my files (about 3GB) to my a folder on my desktop. The Sandisk card gave a very respectable (for a class2 device) 4.5 MB/s transfer rate. When transferring the same files to the Kingston card using the same card adapter and SD slot, the transfer rate maxed out a 50 KB/s. It would have taken me more than 10 hours to transfer my files from my PC to the Kingston card. A Class 4 device should have a _minimum_ sustained write speed of 4 MB/s. I ordered this product fulfilled by Amazon, and I am sure Amazon is not sending me any knock-off products.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion.

Decelles"],"Review Category":["Product"],"Review":["I have purchased Kingston Memory products in the past, including USB Thumb drives, SD Cards and PC RAM and I have always found them to be relatively high quality and to perform decently. This product is the only exception to date, but it so horribly under performs that other potential customers deserve a warning. I bought this card to replace the 8GB Class2 Sandisk card that came with my HTC EVO. The first step to swapping out cards once I got them, was to transfer my files to my computer (I don't have 2 card readers). I used the adapter that came with the Kingston microSD card to plug my Sandisk microSD card into my computer and transferred all my files (about 3GB) to my a folder on my desktop. The Sandisk card gave a very respectable (for a class2 device) 4.5 MB/s transfer rate. When transferring the same files to the Kingston card using the same card adapter and SD slot, the transfer rate maxed out a 50 KB/s. It would have taken me more than 10 hours to transfer my files from my PC to the Kingston card. A Class 4 device should have a _minimum_ sustained write speed of 4 MB/s. I ordered this product fulfilled by Amazon, and I am sure Amazon is not sending me any knock-off products.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion. So 7.45 Giga-Byte comes to just about 8 billion bytes, which means '8GB' to marketing people."]}, {"Username":["Dimitri"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["kingston card with a generic adapter in questionable packaging ... read and write rates not where they're supposed to be ... card was used and scratches were present at the micro sd card.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion. So 7.45 Giga-Byte comes to just about 8 billion bytes, which means '8GB' to marketing people."]}, {"Username":["Dimitri"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["kingston card with a generic adapter in questionable packaging ... read and write rates not where they're supposed to be ... card was used and scratches were present at the micro sd card.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion. So 7.45 Giga-Byte comes to just about 8 billion bytes, which means '8GB' to marketing people."]}, {"Username":["Dimitri"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["kingston card with a generic adapter in questionable packaging ... read and write rates not where they're supposed to be ... card was used and scratches were present at the micro sd card.

I took three stars off because of the ambiguity regarding the packaging, and based on comments from other reviewers it seems clear that the authenticity of these chips is highly suspect.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion. So 7.45 Giga-Byte comes to just about 8 billion bytes, which means '8GB' to marketing people."]}, {"Username":["Dimitri"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["kingston card with a generic adapter in questionable packaging ... read and write rates not where they're supposed to be ... card was used and scratches were present at the micro sd card.

I installed the latest Blackberry Operating System from RIM first, because I had a first-generation Curve, and had read reviews that said the old OS didn't support the bigger cards. I have had no problems at all with installation or the use of the card. Useable space was 7.4 GB at installation; I did not have to do any kind of formatting or other modificaton to use the card.

This chip is sold as 'new' but it didn't come in the manufacturer's retail packaging. Did I actually get a used product? Or does this seller buy in bulk and then repackage for resale? If the latter, then this seller should disclose the fact. If the former, well then... In any event the chip works for my purpose, so I'm giving 2 stars. I took three stars off because of the ambiguity regarding the packaging, and based on comments from other reviewers it seems clear that the authenticity of these chips is highly suspect.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion. So 7.45 Giga-Byte comes to just about 8 billion bytes, which means '8GB' to marketing people."]}, {"Username":["Dimitri"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["kingston card with a generic adapter in questionable packaging ... read and write rates not where they're supposed to be ... card was used and scratches were present at the micro sd card.

I took three stars off because of the ambiguity regarding the packaging, and based on comments from other reviewers it seems clear that the authenticity of these chips is highly suspect.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion. So 7.45 Giga-Byte comes to just about 8 billion bytes, which means '8GB' to marketing people."]}, {"Username":["Dimitri"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["kingston card with a generic adapter in questionable packaging ... read and write rates not where they're supposed to be ... card was used and scratches were present at the micro sd card.

I installed the latest Blackberry Operating System from RIM first, because I had a first-generation Curve, and had read reviews that said the old OS didn't support the bigger cards. I have had no problems at all with installation or the use of the card. Useable space was 7.4 GB at installation; I did not have to do any kind of formatting or other modificaton to use the card. It has been nice to expand the selection of music stored on my Blackberry from about 500 songs to over 800, with lots more room.

(Yes, 8 + 16 = 24, but it's the old 1000 vs 1024 thing.) So far so good. Configuration has survived a couple of hard-resets and everything seems to work properly. Funny thing about the packaging. This chip is sold as 'new' but it didn't come in the manufacturer's retail packaging. Did I actually get a used product? Or does this seller buy in bulk and then repackage for resale? If the latter, then this seller should disclose the fact. If the former, well then... In any event the chip works for my purpose, so I'm giving 2 stars. I took three stars off because of the ambiguity regarding the packaging, and based on comments from other reviewers it seems clear that the authenticity of these chips is highly suspect. If you're looking for the cheapest price and are willing to take a chance, go ahead. If not, you should probably avoid this purchase.

The price I paid was nearly 2x higher than right now, but at least the speed rating was (relatively) honest back then. One disturbing trend I observed recently is that: many flash memory manufacturers seem to be playing games with speed-class ratings of their cards. By definition, a 'class-4' card means it must sustain a MINIMUM write speed of 4MB/s; a 'class-10' means 10MB/s, and so on. But I have tested some so-called 'class-10' cards (Kingston SD10G2/16GB and PNY P-SDU32G3010-EFS2) which can hardly achieve MAXIMUM 10MB/s under the most favorable test conditions. This Kingston Class-4 microSDHC, on the other hand, performed exceedingly well in my benchmark: - For smaller files of 1MB to 15MB, this card can achieve write speed between 6.5MB/s and 10MB/s - For huge file size of 1GB each, its write speed is 9.4MB/s - The read speed is consistently high at ~16MB/s, regardless of file size That means this Kinston microSDHC card easily exceeded the requirement of a 'class-4' card. It would probably be called a 'class-6' (or higher) in today's market. I consider it a great value, especially at the present low price of just one buck per GB. I only wish all manufacturers can continue to give honest speed class ratings to their memory cards. [Aside] The capacity of this card, as reported by my computer, is only 7.45GB. This is actually normal because computer people define one 'Giga' as \"2 to the power 30\", which is about 7.4% larger than 1 billion. So 7.45 Giga-Byte comes to just about 8 billion bytes, which means '8GB' to marketing people."]}, {"Username":["Dimitri"],"Review Category":["Both"],"Review":["kingston card with a generic adapter in questionable packaging ... read and write rates not where they're supposed to be ... card was used and scratches were present at the micro sd card.

This memory card is being used as added memory in a Garmin Oregon 400t GPS receiver. Works perfectly and shows up as an external drive when connected via the Oregon's USB cable. A minor issue people should realize, not with the memory card itself, is that above 2GB is considered high-capacity and only directly read by newer Vista computers and not other computers or scanner/copiers with card slots.

The card was not being read at all, and I made sure not to jam the micro card or place it incorrectly. Therein, I eliminate any operation error. After careful inspection I found out that the SDadapter had slightly shifted open. Which is caused by the use CHEAP plastic and bad tolerances. With this shift, the adapter pins could not make proper contact with the microSD card and therefore it didn't worked. Now, I am using a competitor brand adapter and the microSD card still works well.

I replaced this card with the class 4 32 gig from SanDisk, and it works reliably. I believe NoDo speeds up memory funcion in some way and this results in unreliable performance from this Kensington card. Further proof (and a possible saving grace) is that wireless sync still works with NoDo and this card. It's much slower than USB sync, of course, but my guess is that's why it still work. For Windows Phone 7, my suggestion is to stick with SanDisk, and pray a bit. After all, Microsoft and the phone manufacturers have only officially OKed one card (a SanDisk 8 gig) at this point anyway.
